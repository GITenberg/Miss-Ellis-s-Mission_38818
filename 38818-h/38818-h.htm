<h2>MISS ELLIS'S MISSION.</h2>


<p>This little sketch of Miss Ellis's life and work owes its first
suggestion to Rev. J. Ll. Jones, of Chicago, who soon after her death
wrote: "Why not try for a little memorial of her, to be accompanied with
some of the most touching and searching extracts from the letters both
received and written by her, and make it into a little booklet for the
instruction of Post Office Mission Workers?... Can you not make it
something as touching as 'Miss Toosey,' and far more practical,&mdash;that
is, for our own little household of faith?... We do not want it
primarily as a missionary tool, but as a wee fragment of the spiritual
history of the world,&mdash;something that will lift and touch the soul of
everybody.... In short, give us an enlightened Miss Toosey; her mission
being as much stronger as Sallie Ellis was more rational and mature than
the original 'Miss Toosey'!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>No one knowing Miss Ellis could read the touching little story of "Miss
Toosey's Mission" without being struck by a resemblance in the
characters, though a resemblance with a marked difference. As one said,
"I never saw her going up the church aisle Sundays, with her audiphone,
her little satchel, her bundle of books and papers, and her hymn-book,
without thinking of Miss Toosey." In both lives a seemingly powerless
and insignificant personality, through the force of a great yearning to
do a bit of God's work in the world, achieved its longing far beyond its
fondest dreams. As I read the many letters from all over the country
that have come since Miss Ellis's death, as I realize how the spiritual
force that burned in the soul of this small, feeble, seemingly helpless
woman reached out afar and touched many lives for their enduring
ennoblement, her life, so meagre and cramped in its outward aspect, so
vivid and intense within and on paper, seems to me not without a touch
of romance. To perpetuate a little longer the influence of that life is
the object of this sketch.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">Sallie Ellis</span> was born in Cincinnati, March 13, 1835. The old-fashioned
name Sallie, at that time popular in the South and West, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> given her
in honor of an aunt. She disliked sailing under the false colors of
"Sarah." In letters she usually signed herself "S. Ellis," because, as
she explained to one correspondent, "I do not know myself as <i>Sarah</i>,
and Sallie is not dignified enough in writing to strangers; so I usually
prefer plain S." Late in life, however, for reasons of dignity, she
sometimes felt forced to adopt Sarah as what she called her "official
signature."</p>

<p>Her father, Mr. Rowland Ellis, was born in Boston, but while yet young
removed to Cincinnati, where he still lives in a vigorous and honored
old age. Although his mother, in all her later years at least, was a
devoted attendant upon Theodore Parker's services, Mr. Ellis in early
life was a Baptist. But when the Unitarian Church was founded at
Cincinnati, in 1830, his name appears among the organizers, of whom he
is almost the sole survivor. Of that church he has always been a devoted
supporter and constant attendant. He was a leading banker of the West,
and Sallie was born into one of the most elegant and luxurious homes in
Cincinnati. The Ellises kept open house, exercised the most generous
hospitality, and made, as one says who knew them well then, "such a
beautiful use of their money. The Ellises were just the people who
<i>ought</i> to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> money." Mrs. Ellis is described as a woman of unusual
loveliness of character. Out of the eight children, Sallie was thought
to be the mother's favorite, because, it was supposed, she was always
puny, shy, and delicate. "Sallie shall always have what she wants," said
the mother, "because she wants so little." But mothers <i>know</i>, and
undoubtedly the mother saw deeper than others into the rare spiritual
quality concealed from the world under her delicate child's quiet,
reserved exterior. Her older sister remembers of Sallie's childhood: "As
a very young child she exhibited strongly marked peculiarities of
character. Her affection, conscientiousness, piety, and love of duty
made her different from the rest of us as children. I remember well that
at home or at school there were never any rebukes for Sallie. Though
very social by nature, as young as at five and six years of age she
loved to be alone, and would sit in the corner of her mother's room,
with face turned to the corner, musing, and talking in a low tone to her
doll. When our father and mother would take the children to
entertainments of various descriptions, such as children enjoy, Sallie
would invariably express her preference to remain at home. If she
thought her parents wanted her to go, she went."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>For some years Sallie attended the private school of Mrs. Anne Ryland,
an English Unitarian (a former parishioner, I think, of Rev. Laut
Carpenter, and connected by marriage with Rev. Brooke Herford), a lady
of noble character, and a teacher whose culture and methods were in
advance of her age. In a volume of poetry presented Sallie by this
teacher, is this inscription, whose old-fashioned quaintness of phrase
pictures for us the Sallie Ellis of thirteen, then, as always, faithful
to duty.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Mrs. Ryland has been much gratified by the general deportment of
Miss Sallie Ellis since she has been under her charge. Miss Ellis
has evinced an evident desire to please, by a strict observance of
the rules of the school, and by assiduous and persevering attention
to all her studies. She has made improvement in them all fully
commensurate with her laudable endeavors, in Grammar, Geography,
and Orthography particularly. It is with unfeigned regret that Mrs.
Ryland has to add, to the foregoing expression of her approval of
her dear pupil's conduct, the last word,&mdash;Farewell."</p></blockquote>

<p>Later, she attended the private school of Rev. William Silsbee, who says
of her, "She was always studious and well-behaved, one of the most
faithful of all my pupils." Mr. M. Hazen White,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> for so many years
superintendent of the Unitarian Sunday school, was also one of her
teachers. When seventeen, she was sent to Mrs. Charles Sedgwick's
school, in Lenox, Mass. A schoolmate describes her then as a quite
pretty, black-eyed girl, of delicate physique, a good and studious but
not brilliant scholar, very quiet and retiring, and almost morbidly
reserved. The few friends she made here, however, were life-long, and
she corresponded with some of the Lenox schoolmates until her death.
"She was a perfect dancer," says the schoolmate.</p>

<p>Treasured among Miss Ellis's papers were found some pages of a
schoolgirl's album, marked, "At Mrs. Sedgwick's School, Lenox, Mass.,
March, 1852." It contains verses descriptive of each pupil, written
apparently by Mrs. Sedgwick. The little pen-picture of the schoolgirl
paints well the woman of later years.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Bright indeed looked Sallie's future in those days. A year or two more
at school, then a return to the loved mother and the beautiful home, and
a "coming out" into the brilliant world with all the advantages
attending wealth and position. But the clouds were already gathering
which in coming years were to darken for her in quick succession the
sunshine of earthly prosperity. She was called home from school by the
illness of her mother. The mother died, leaving Sallie the oldest
daughter at home, to fill her place as best she might to five little
brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>Her sister says: "Our dear mother's death was the turning-point in
Sallie's life. She was so shrinking, sensitive, and tender by nature, no
one could fully understand her but a mother who had watched the hidden
beauties of her character expand from infancy to girlhood."</p>

<p>The mother's memory was fondly cherished, her loss deeply mourned, all
Miss Ellis's life. Over the dying bed of the worn and weary woman of
fifty smiled down the radiant face of the mother, painted when a young,
blooming girl. Among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> Miss Ellis's papers was found a manuscript volume
of eighty-one pages of selections, copied in her clear, firm
handwriting, index of the spirit's strength. It is headed, "Crumbs of
Comfort for the Afflicted." The selections are from the Bible, sermons,
hymns, and poems,&mdash;all breathing of religious trust and help in
grief,&mdash;a beautiful and touching collection. The first page reads,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Begun in Nov. 1870.</p>

<p>"These selections are made in memory of my dear mother, who was
called away many years since, and through whose death I was led to
think of a higher life,&mdash;the <i>true</i> life of the soul.</p>

<p>"'Oh, I believe there is no <i>away</i>; that no love, no life, goes
ever from us; it goes as He went, that it may come again, deeper
and closer and surer, and be with us always, even unto the end of
the world' (<i>Patience Strong's Outings</i>)."</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the selections is an anonymous poem, "The Strength of the
Lonely." On one page Miss Ellis had written (signed "S. E."), "I can but
believe that God allows a mother still to watch over and care for her
family when he takes her from this world, and in our affliction that he
draws us to himself, and to Jesus as our guide to him, through her
spiritual influence, just as, while upon earth, he permitted her to be
his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> instrument to lead and guide us in all that is good. All children
too, even the youngest, are God's instruments for good, and their
ministries cease not with their earthly life. The departed are with us
everywhere, through our daily duties,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"In the loneliest hour, in the crowd, they are nigh us."</p></blockquote>

<p>A year or two after the mother's death Sallie joined the Unitarian
Church, being baptized by Rev. A. A. Livermore, of whom she writes in a
letter: "Rev. A. A. Livermore was settled here from the time I was
fourteen to twenty-one, and he formed my religious character." Fitting
indeed was it that he who has trained so many young men for the ministry
should dedicate to God's service this young woman, also destined to be
his minister to many souls. An old lady in the church remembers seeing
Sallie go up to be baptized, leading a little brother by each hand, all
the little children being baptized at the same time. To one of her
nature, the vows then taken were a most sacred, real consecration of her
whole self to God,&mdash;vows to be nobly fulfilled in the life.</p>

<p>Mr. Livermore writes of her:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"During my pastorate of the Unitarian Church in Cincinnati, Mr. and
Mrs. Rowland Ellis were valued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> parishioners of mine, and their
children were all baptized by me. It was a lovely group of little
folks, and the spirit of that consecration has gone largely through
all their lives, and given them, I believe, the Christian flavor.
They have, too, been very warmly united as a family, and in health
and sickness, in life and death, they have borne strong testimony
to the blessed anchorage of a positive religious faith.</p>

<p>"They were also diligent attendants on the Sunday school in the
basement of the old church. Sallie's bright face and upright
attitude was to be seen in her place as sure as the Sunday came.</p>

<p>"After I left Cincinnati I saw her but seldom, but on those
occasions she always spoke of the earlier times in the church and
the Sunday school with a warmth and glow of memory that showed that
they had been real points of life to her mind and character. And
especially after her deafness became a chastening hand laid upon
her character, and family sorrows and bereavements followed in the
train, it was plain that she found her religious trust the one
thing needful."</p></blockquote>

<p>Within another year business reverses swept away Mr. Ellis's entire
fortune. As he had meantime married a lady who proved a most capable and
devoted mother to the younger children, Sallie, released from domestic
cares, felt that she ought to do something to assist her father. "She
was so modest," says a friend, "I don't think it ever occurred to her
that she could teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> school. But she said there was one thing she knew
she could do, and do well, and that was, to dance." So Miss Sallie
became a dancing-teacher, having classes of children in their mothers'
parlors.</p>

<p>Another friend (whose boys, now stalwart men in the church, were among
Miss Ellis's pupils) says of her: "She was a lovely dancing-teacher. She
not only taught the children to dance well, but she taught them such
gentle, lovely manners. Indeed, the significant thing in Miss Ellis's
life, to me, was her faithfulness. Whatever her hand found to do, she
did, and did well. Because she had been so faithful at dancing-school,
she was able to be so successful a teacher. Because, when taught sewing,
she tried so hard to do her best, she became such a beautiful sewer, and
was able to teach sewing;" for a sewing-class was another expedient of
those days.</p>

<p>Her father moved to Chicago in 1851, where he resided three years. There
Miss Ellis attended Mr. Shippen's church, taught a Sunday-school class,
and had a class of newsboys evenings. After the return to Cincinnati,
while Miss Ellis was at the sea-shore, she began to experience a painful
roaring in the ears. Hearing, never quite perfect, was soon almost
totally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> gone. The following years are little, to outward sight, but a
record of invalidism, of trying this or that doctor, but still ever
decreasing health and strength. Many dyspeptics, from Carlyle to lesser
folk, have felt their disease, like charity, a cover for a multitude of
sins. Miss Ellis suffered from chronic dyspepsia of aggravated type,
from catarrhal and other troubles which finally wore away the always
frail thread of life in consumptive decline.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>But through all these hard years Miss Ellis was doing what she could,
and longing to do more. Until deafness prevented, she always taught in
Sunday school. She was a devoted attendant on all church services, and
worker in all church causes. The perfection of her handiwork made it in
great demand. Knowing now Miss Ellis's possibilities, one almost grudges
the Unitarian children, and the innumerable but beloved little nephews
and nieces, the years of "Aunt Sallie's" life that went into dainty
embroidery and perfect mittens for their wearing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> The church fairs were
always liberally aided by her willing hands. Indeed, it is difficult,
without seeming exaggeration, to express her passion of devotion to her
church. It was literally her life. Outside her family, to which she was
warmly attached, everything centred for her there, and for many years
one of her heaviest crosses was her inability to render the service she
desired to her church and denomination.</p>

<p>The portrait prefacing this book was taken in 1871, when Miss Ellis was
thirty-six years old,&mdash;perhaps the saddest period in her life. Youth,
health, fortune, hearing, dear friends, had gone one after another. The
future looked dark indeed. She felt within herself capacities for which
there seemed no earthly opportunity. The face wears a sadder expression
than that characterizing it in later life, when at last she had found
her real work.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Rev. Charles Noyes was settled as Unitarian pastor in Cincinnati in
1872. To him Miss Ellis always attributed her first missionary impulse.</p>

<p>In a letter to Rev. W. C. Gannett, July 28, 1885, she said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Yes, it is a <i>great</i> source of comfort to have started the 'good
seed,' and now to see so many stronger people taking up the work
and doing so much better than I. A great deal is due to dear Mr.
Charles Noyes. He won me by his kind heart while here, and was so
kind in lending me his manuscripts always, and books, that he kept
me along with the religion of the day. Then Mr. Weudte furthered
the matter by putting me on the Missionary Committee, and finally
started me out with the 'Pamphlet Mission.' You know the rest."</p></blockquote>

<p>In her diary was a copy of a letter written Mr. Noyes on his departure
from Cincinnati, dated June 23, 1875, a portion of which is here given.</p>

<blockquote><p>"I cannot say 'so be it' to your departure without returning thanks
for the many pleasant hours you have afforded me through your
manuscripts, the books and papers you have so kindly lent me from
time to time. You have given me something to think about for a long
time, so I can do without any sermons for a while. I do not expect
to find so kind a pastor very soon.</p>

<p>"From your first text, 'The Spirit of the Lord is upon me. Take
heed, therefore, how ye hear,' I accepted you as a teacher learning
more from God than from man. I have followed you from beginning to
the end, and I have worked <i>with</i> you and <i>for</i> you to the best of
my ability, my strength, and my means. Would I had been a more
efficient worker! I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> taken heed as to how I have heard. You
have not changed my views so much as brought out more clearly what
was already in my own mind. The best lesson I have learned from you
is a firmer trust in God. You have brought me to the 'Source of all
Truth, whence Jesus drew his life.' Here you leave me. An essential
point to have reached, in my view; a firm rock on which to rest,
and one that can never be taken from me. Some people are not
satisfied with a faith so simple. They need more to rest on; as if
there could be a stronger, better support than the 'voice in the
soul.' From loss of hearing, the 'voice within' has spoken more
clearly to me perhaps.... It is a very great disappointment to me
to part with you and your family, for I have become very much
attached to you all; for even little G&mdash;&mdash; has learned to look upon
me as a friend. It is not every one who wins me; and when one does,
it is all the harder to separate from him. Still, we are often
compelled to give up our preferences, as I have learned before
now.... The benediction I ask is the one you have so often asked
for us (Mary&mdash;&mdash;ears to me, and a reliable authority): 'May the
Heavenly Father bless, preserve, and guide you all. May he give you
wisdom to know and strength to do his holy will forevermore.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Noyes, being asked for his recollections of Miss Ellis, writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Sallie had a very true, deep, strong religious nature, and a
leaning to religious, not to say theological,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> studies. Alone in
Cincinnati when I first went there, I was often a guest at Mr.
Ellis's Sunday table. Sallie borrowed my sermons. She liked to talk
over the subject of the sermon, and this led to my recommending to
her many books for her reading, and loaning to her what I had in my
library. She became familiar with the writings of most of our
Unitarian writers,&mdash;with Channing, Clarke, Hedge, Dewey, Norton,
Furness, and many others. She was no careless reader, but a student
of the writer's thought.... She had great breadth of mental
outlook, and a great heart of charity and love for all. She admired
the diversity of opinion in our body, and had faith in the unity of
the Spirit that would fuse us into one.... If Sallie ever expressed
wonder and surprise, it was that Unitarianism did not grow as fast
as it ought, and that those who accepted its teachings did not
identify themselves with it. We had our Mission School of about
three hundred pupils, and our Sewing School.... The time had not
come for the Pamphlet Mission or the Post Office; yet Miss Ellis
was making the best preparation possible for her after-work, and in
due time the door of best usefulness stood wide open. You know, as
we all know, how well she filled her office.... Her letters were
sermons,&mdash;tracts in themselves, best adapted to her correspondents,
and, I am persuaded, did a grand work of their own. She heard with
difficulty, she was not an easy talker, but she wrote with great
clearness.... More than the books she sent out, she was to many a
one the blessed missionary of our faith.... In her early studies
the miracle question was a stumbling-block to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> Sallie. The old-time
interpretation of miracle she could not accept; neither could she
take up with the mythical theory of Strauss. Miracle must be in
harmony with law. Jesus must be to her the natural flower of
<i>human</i> nature, the perfect blossom of <i>human</i> development. Nature
and the supernatural must be in harmony. Hence the delight she took
in Dr. Furness's works. His works helped her, as they have so many
others, out of her difficulties about the supernatural. And more
than that, they fed her religious life, pure and simple, and let
her into the heart of Christ. She often alluded to her debt to Dr.
Furness, whom she admired and loved."</p></blockquote>

<p>Miss Ellis little expected or would have desired to figure as a
Unitarian saint. Her estimate of herself was lowly. Whatever her faults
and limitations, however, they were only those natural to a strong
nature driven in upon itself, beating in vain against the stern walls
that everywhere surrounded it. Bravely did she strive to resist what she
clearly perceived to be the natural tendencies of her peculiar troubles,
and bravely did she succeed. The prayers, the tears, the struggles of
those lonely, baffled years are known only to God, and are only hinted
at here and there in the diary kept during a large part of her life. An
unique diary it is, showing, as nothing else could, the passion of
religious devotion which burned in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> her soul. Each day's record, no
matter how brief, ends with passages of Scripture, or sometimes a hymn,
appropriate to the day's mood or experience. In reading it, one realizes
afresh the richness of the Bible in comfort and strength. The diary
furnishes a complete history of the Unitarian Church of Cincinnati for
many years. All the individual joys and sorrows of its members, their
birthdays and their death-days, are here recorded with loving sympathy.
Also, a complete record of every Sunday's service for many years is
given, with always a full abstract of the sermon, sometimes filling
several pages of fine, close writing. Occasionally it happened that the
minister failed to hand Miss Sallie his sermon after delivery,&mdash;a
grievous disappointment, almost too great to bear, as the diary
testifies. Each year the personal matter grows less, the religious
meditations and quotations consume more and more space, until of the
journal in the last years her sister writes: "It seems to have been kept
mainly to give vent to her pure, spiritual nature, which was ever
longing for some expression of itself." A very few extracts are here
given from the diary,&mdash;a glimpse only of the struggles and longings that
unconsciously to herself were all fitting her for her work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="DIARY" id="DIARY"></a>DIARY.</h2>


<blockquote><p>1873. I have been too indolent for a few years. Now I must be up
and doing, with a heart for anything, and remember that these
clouds that overshadow us all are meant to make us look beyond for
the sunshine. "No cross, no crown." I have a project in my head
that I wish very much to carry out. I am tired of my selfish life;
and all that reconciles me to it is, that I accept it as a
necessary discipline for my restless spirit, to teach me
submission, and help me to say, "Thy will, not mine, be done." My
idea of a <i>true</i> Christian is to be working for others always, and
not thinking of self. My desire is, to start a sewing-class from
the Mission School, to be kept up during the summer, if I can only
get the means of carrying out my plan, and find some one who is
willing to take charge of it in case I am not able to be there. I
would <i>gladly</i> make the sacrifice of personal comfort.</p></blockquote>

<p>The sewing-class was started, and Miss Ellis became one of its most
devoted teachers, though working often in great feebleness and pain.</p>

<blockquote><p>Feel bluer, but I believe my deafness is bringing me truer faith,
and resignation.... Another very warm day, but I have managed to
get through the day cheerfully, thinking of heavenly things.... I
cannot understand what makes me so ugly sometimes. I pray that my
evil spirit may be subdued some day.... Do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> know of anything I
have done to benefit others to-day, only I have been cheerful.... I
have felt pretty well, and this day went rightly with me, though I
do not know as I have advanced the cause of life very much.... How
I do long to live a perfectly unselfish life, and to be a blessing
to those around me, as my life was intended for!... Am reading "Old
Kensington," by Miss Thackeray,&mdash;a real love-story; and it makes me
sad, as usual.... Still in the house, and feel poorly. Feel a
little dull this evening, and on thinking over my life, think that
I have had more than most people of my age to endure, and wonder
that I keep up my spirits as well as I have; and it is only that I
feel that all is the necessary discipline for me. "Let us but be
genuine, honest, and true in everything, even in the smallest
thing, and we have in that the sign and the pledge of entire
consecration of heart and life to God" (J. F. Clarke). "Be faithful
unto death, and I will give you a crown of life" (Rev. ii. 10)....
Gave up to a <i>terrible</i> fit of the "blues" this afternoon and
evening. Am <i>so</i> tired of suffering all the time, that I gave way
under my cross to-day. It seems as if I can't struggle to live
longer.</p>

<p><i>Sunday.</i> A bright day; I was not able to go out, but felt that it
was good to remain at home to think over my blessings.... Attended
Bible-class this evening. I came home in rather a despondent mood.
I find my cross hard to bear, but must pray for more strength.</p>

<p>1874. Sent my old Bible to be bound to-day, which I have used
twenty-three years.... I have felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> extremely favored to-day, in
that I was able to attend the Sewing School, which I feared all the
week I might be disappointed in. We closed the school to-day, after
twenty-four weeks' work. It has been time well spent, and I feel
particularly thankful to my heavenly Father in having heard my
prayer for health, strength, and good weather. One strong desire of
my life has been vouchsafed me, and I feel overpowered with joy
to-night.... I have felt to-day how much I need the assistance of
Christ, and may his religion help me to be victorious in the end.</p></blockquote>

<p>Quoting an extract from Miss Sedgwick's diary on the unmarried life,
which ends, "Though not <i>first</i> to any, I am, like Themistocles,
<i>second</i> to a great many: my sisters are all kind and affectionate to
me, my brothers generous and invariably kind; their children all love
me," Miss Ellis adds: "These <i>very words</i> I can repeat as my
experience.... If I can only add a few <i>drops</i> of happiness to his life
[a brother's], I shall be too happy."</p>

<blockquote><p>1875. Mr. Noyes called Monday to bring me his sermon, and it made
me very resigned. The text was from 2 Cor. xii. 10,&mdash;"When I am
weak, then am I strong."</p></blockquote>

<p>Paul's "thorn in the flesh" was the topic of the discourse, and several
pages of extracts are copied in the journal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>It is one of the trials of my life not to assist in the church as I
desire to. I presume it must be because I neglect other duties, and
see but one thing before me, and that is, to give up the <i>idol</i> of
my life, and do the duty that is nearest to me; but it is a sore
trial to me.... This has been an eventful week to me, for last
Sunday Mr. Noyes closed his ministry with us.... Now they have
really gone, it makes me feel rather despondent, though I know they
have left many blessings to me behind them.</p>

<p>I am beginning some fancy work, in hopes of brightening my life
somewhat. I am not reconciled to the hardships of life.... Am
anxious to learn wood-carving.... I try to have the faith <i>of</i>
Jesus more than that about him.</p>

<p>... Went to see about trumpets yesterday, and came home greatly
disheartened, and shall have to submit with a good grace to the
cross.... Mr. Wendte lectures on the New Testament this evening. I
should be glad to hear him, but believe all is best as it is.</p>

<p>1877. We had a beautiful sermon to-day, which I took especially to
myself, on "The Lonely Hours of Life." ... Am feeling better
to-day, and the sermon (on "Be Strong, and of a Good Courage")
roused my better nature, ready to go on courageously.... Lecture
this evening on "Funeral Customs." I did not attend, for the sermon
to-day (on "Prayer") so exalted me that I didn't feel like
listening to things of the world.... Wakened feeling disconsolate
this morning, but resolved to bear the cross of life as trustfully
and cheerfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> as possible, and lay up treasures during the summer
ready to "give out" when all return in the winter. Impressed two
little pieces on my mind,&mdash;one by Spitta, in "Day unto Day,"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Glad with thy light and glowing with thy love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So let me ever think and speak and move."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The other by Whittier,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Lord, help me strive 'gainst each besetting sin."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Went to Madame Wendte's. Brought home, "Ten Great Religions,"
"Reason in Religion," and "Evolution in Religion."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus did Miss Ellis fortify herself for the summer vacation of the
church. Emerson's "Society and Solitude" was another book read this
vacation.</p>

<blockquote><p>Have not lived up to my ideal the past week, and particularly
to-day. However, may the good Father pardon my shortcomings and aid
me to do better.... I feel that I have added something to my life
for the benefit of others by the rest and reading of this summer. I
hope to study up German a little, among my busy hours this winter.
I can retain so little in my head, it is discouraging to read. I
must work the harder, and believe "all is for the best," and pray,
in faith, for patience.... Mr. Wendte's first sermon&mdash;subject,
"After Vacation"&mdash;made me feel somewhat depressed, for I feel so
anxious to do for <i>every one</i>, and have not the means or strength.
[She resolves to]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> do my little part and not discourage [the
minister],&mdash;do my part more by showing an interest than by the
amount of work I do.... I am miserable, dyspeptic, and
disappointed.... I have felt heartily discouraged this week in
every way, but the church did me good this morning.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Noyes was succeeded as pastor at Cincinnati by Rev. Charles W.
Wendte in the fall of 1875. The idea of preaching, of carrying to others
the blessed Unitarian faith which had been her joy and strength, now
filled Miss Ellis's soul. She discussed various schemes to this end with
friends who respected her and her earnestness too much to laugh at the
(in worldly eyes) utter absurdity of her hopes, as futile as Miss
Toosey's desire to go as a missionary to Nawaub. Could she not go out
into Ohio villages and hold lay services, reading the printed prayers
and sermons of our Unitarian ministers? Great must have been the
yearning for the ministry consuming her soul, to tempt the reserved,
feeble little woman, with her deafness and dyspepsia, her incessant
cough, her love of her own room and things, her exactness and exquisite
nicety of habit, seriously to contemplate such a career. Yet, but for
absolute physical incapacity, and the dissuasions (on that account) of
her family, she would certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> have made the experiment. Or might she
not open a reading-room in the church, to be kept open all the week,
where the treasures of Unitarian literature could be dispensed? Even in
her last years she seriously meditated going to the church every Sunday
morning during the vacation to open her library and meet those who might
want books, papers, or advice. The summer vacation was always a grief to
her. She wished the church might be open every day.</p>

<p>Nov. 9, 1876, a rough draft of the following letter to Mr. Wendte
appears in her diary:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I cannot resist returning special thanks for your sermon of last
Sunday, 'To what end is your life?' I do not know when a sermon has
so fully aroused the will of my youth.... At twenty years of age,
'the object of my toil' was to live for the earthly comfort of the
family, for the good of society in general, so far as in my power,
at the same time keeping an eye to the higher interests of life by
working in and for the church.... 'The goal of my ambition' in
middle life is to labor for the spiritual welfare of those about
me; but I find myself without means to assist others.... My
preference is decidedly to labor for the higher natures of others
as well as for myself; therefore, remembering your kind offer in
your letter to me during the summer, I ask, can you suggest
anything for me to engage in, in the spreading of Christianity?
[She wishes] to devote the remainder of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> life to the highest and
best I know. If you can put me in the way of assisting others as
well as myself in the highest and holiest way, I shall be ever
indebted to you. I shall be glad to so live that when I lay down my
life I shall in some measure have returned the many kindnesses of
parents, sisters, brothers, and friends, repaid the efforts of
teachers and pastors in my behalf, and proved myself a worthy child
to Him who gave me being."</p></blockquote>

<p>At the end, however, she writes: "Didn't send it. Concluded it was
better to talk with him."</p>

<p>The same ideas in another form appear again in the diary as a letter to
Mr. Wendte. One of the burdens on Mr. Wendte's heart in those days was
"to find something for Miss Ellis to do." Partly to this end he devised
Sunday-school lessons in manuscript, which Miss Ellis copied each week
for all the teachers. In 1877 he appointed a Missionary Society with a
formidable list of names, the significant one among whom events proved
to be Miss Sallie Ellis, Treasurer,&mdash;she being, indeed, the "society."
The little programme says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The object of the Missionary Society is to spread the knowledge
and increase the influence of Liberal religious ideas throughout
the city and State by publications, correspondence, and such other
means as may seem to it suitable and best."</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>During the winter of 1877-78 Miss Ellis, aided by Mr. Wendte,
distributed 1,846 tracts and 211 "Pamphlet Missions" (as baby "Unity"
was called) in twenty-six States. Miss Ellis was always scrupulously
systematic, methodical, and exact in all she did, and a huge pile of
closely written blank books gives every minutia connected with the
business details of her work. In her diary was a copy of this letter to
Mr. Wendte, dated Feb. 21, 1878:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Why not have a 'Mission Sunday' sometime soon? Do not announce it
previously, however; for some might feel inclined to remain at
home; but catch as many together as possible, and make them listen
to a rousing address from you,&mdash;a report of what you have done and
the letters you have received. It might not be as social or
interesting as a concert or something else; but it would not hurt
the people to listen to it, and would make the missionary work more
a reality to them, and I believe in the end an appeal from you
would bring in more money than anything else.</p>

<p>"I have one request to make of you, however; and that is, that you
do not bring my name out in the pulpit, unless you have occasion to
mention the names of the Missionary Society. It is merely necessary
to mention you have been assisted by one of the 'Missionary
Committee,' not saying 'Treasurer,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> man or woman. I have no
objection if any one asks you privately who has done the work, to
have you tell them. I love to do good work, but wish no other
praise than to know that the recipient of the act has been
benefited thereby. I act from the mere pleasure of doing good to
others and believing it to be right, therefore deserve no
credit.... The winter's work has brought out the desire of younger
days, when a Presbyterian friend used to tell me, 'You ought to go
as a missionary to China.' I then had five little brothers and
sisters to help care for, and considered that 'mission' enough.
Since they are grown my health has been too poor to undertake
anything, but now I should like a work in life. If I have a 'taste'
or 'talent' for anything, it is for the study and the spread of
religion.... All the family are only too kind to me, which only
makes me the more anxious to use my one talent to the utmost
extent. If you know of any work I could assist in, in our
denomination, East or West, I would be much obliged to you if you
would let me know."</p></blockquote>

<p>The first mentions in the journal of missionary work are Nov. 25, 1877,
"Mr. Wendte came to me with missionary work to do,&mdash;five hundred tracts
to distribute;" and Dec. 9, 1877, "Feel that I am doing good in lending
books and papers and distributing tracts."</p>

<p>Sept. 5, 1880, while visiting her sister in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> Philadelphia she opens a
new volume of the journal as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Too warm to venture to church. The church in Cincinnati opens
to-day. Would I might be one of the congregation! I <i>am</i>, in
spirit! In opening this book on Sunday I would dedicate it to a
high use, and open it with ascription of praise to the Giver of all
good. "Pray for us unto the Lord thy God, ... that the Lord thy God
may show us the way wherein we may walk" (Jer. xlii. 2, 3).
"Quicken thou me in thy way" (Psalms cxix. 37).</p></blockquote>

<p>The following prayers are then copied:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"My Father, may I ever humbly follow in thy way; may I ever trust,
with the full assurance of faith, that it does lead to thy heavenly
kingdom. It is often narrow and perplexed, and I cannot see where
it is leading me; yet, though the guiding light of thy holy word
may be half obscured by the mists of the valley, if I fix my eyes
steadily upon it, it will become brighter and brighter; I shall see
my way clearly in this seemingly intricate road, and discern, even
at the end of it, the entrance to thy heavenly mansion."</p>

<p>"O God, may our souls be full of life. Save us from an inanimate
and sluggish life.... Inspire our sensibility to good; may we see
more and more its loveliness and beauty. And may all the varied
experience of life draw us nearer to thee" (Channing).</p></blockquote>

<p>Then follows "an abstract from Channing's Memoirs, showing how, by
self-scrutiny, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> character was formed, by many trials and denials."
She then copies eighteen pages from Channing's "Rules for
Self-Discipline," at the end writing, "All these pages from Channing are
written from memory, not copied."</p>

<p>The second rule copied is, "Let me not <i>talk</i> of pains, sicknesses,
complaints," etc.</p>

<p>Following the rules is a poem copied from the "Christian Register" of
Sept. 4, 1880.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">WHAT OF THAT?<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Then follows a selection from Emerson:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The scholar must be a solitary, laborious, modest, and charitable
soul. He must embrace solitude as a bride. He must have his glees
and his glooms alone. Go, scholar, cherish your soul; expel
companions; set your habits to a life of solitude; then will the
faculties rise fair and full within, like forest trees, field
flowers; you will have results, which, when you meet your fellow
men, you can communicate and they will gladly receive. It is the
noble, manly, just thought which is the superiority demanded of
you; and not crowds, but solitude, confers this elevation."</p></blockquote>

<p>Next follows a page of "Paragraphs for Preachers." Evidently this year
sees the dying of the first hope to be a preacher, and the gradual dawn
of her life's real mission. Seven pages follow of "Prayers altered and
rearranged for my own use, from 'Dairy Praise and Prayer.'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> Three or
four appropriate prayers are united in one, headed, "First evening,"
"First Morning," "Second Evening," etc. These were apparently prepared
for the lay services she had dreamed of holding. A page or two more, and
this entry, October 17, marks the dawning of the new hope: "Last week
received a very kind letter from Mr. Wendte, in which he stated, 'We
have made you chairman of a Book and Tract Table in the church;
'therefore I feel bound to return to attend to it." Further extracts
from the diary are:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Saturday evening, J&mdash;&mdash; accidentally broke my audiphone. I felt
<i>lost</i> then, but wouldn't let them know how badly I felt about it,

<p>Miss F. Le Baron, whose friendship with Miss Ellis dates back to the
latter's residence in Chicago, writes that she has several letters from
Miss Ellis setting forth her desire to preach, but unfortunately they
are in a totally inaccessible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> place. This allusion, in the diary,
evidently points to the final renunciation of Miss Ellis's first
missionary impulse:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>November 7.</i> A letter from Miss Le Baron, of Chicago, in regard to
my engaging in missionary work in the West. She finally closed with
the idea that I had come to myself. In a letter from A&mdash;&mdash; this
week she says to me, "<i>Our</i> lot in life appears to be that of
patience and submission," which brings to my mind quite a sermon,
in other's words, which I hope to write out to-day. It is time to
prepare for church.... The thought suggested by A&mdash;&mdash;'s letter with
regard to submission to our lot called to mind the passage William
Ellery Channing wrote to his friend Francis. "You seem to go upon
the supposition that our circumstances are determined by
Providence. I believe they are determined by ourselves. Man is the
artificer of his own fortunes. By exertion he can enlarge his
sphere of usefulness. By activity he can 'multiply himself.' It is
mind that gives him the ascendency in society; it is mind that
gives him power and ability. It depends upon himself to call forth
the energies of mind, to strengthen the intellect, to form
benevolence into a habit of the soul. The consequence I draw from
these principles is that Heaven, by placing me in particular
circumstances, has not assigned me a determinate sphere of
usefulness (as you seem to think), but that it is in my power, and
of course my duty, to spread the 'beams of my light' wider into the
'night of adversity.'"</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Ellis continues, apparently partly in her own words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>With this idea, then, that we largely fashion our own lives, that,
"working with God, and for him, our lives can know no true failure,
but all things shall contribute to our soul's true success," let us
take up our cross, and then we shall find</p>

<p>Two pages more on the same topic, of original and selected matter
skilfully blended (perhaps the whole a bit of one of the sermons never
to be preached), end with the hymn, copied in full,&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">"I ask not wealth, but power to take<br /></span>

<p>and Miss Ellis finally sums all up, "True submission, then, consists in
<i>working</i> out our own salvation, looking to God for strength wherewith
to work." The only entry for the next day is part of the hymn,&mdash;</p>

books and distributed a quantity of free matter.</p>

<p><i>December 5.</i> Am thoroughly on the road to the Book and Tract Table
in the church. Hope it may prove a good thing, and that I shall do
it <i>faithfully</i>.</p>

<p><i>December 12.</i> Have been miserable all the week, and quite sick two
and a half hours Thursday. Couldn't raise my head, and had to
pretty much give up all day. Had sociable this week, and I was on
hand to urge the book trade, and hoped to have a supply to-day, but
was disappointed in it. It was one of the unsatisfactory days to
me, for I have had such a tremendous noise in my head that I
couldn't hear at all.</p>

to the Woman's Auxiliary Missionary work. It has been decided that
I am to take charge of distribution of Liberal publications, also
to canvass for the "Register." Had Mr. Mayo to preach for us
to-day. I was astonished to hear how well I heard him, and how

<p>A long extract is copied into the journal, of which this is a portion:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Blindness only separates a man from Nature, but the loss of
hearing also isolates him, more or less, from human companionship.
As a natural consequence, the deaf are apt to lose interest in the
social life around them, and to grow discontented, suspicious, and
morose. You and I know beautiful examples to the contrary,&mdash;persons
so patient, brave, and uncomplaining amidst their heavy
tribulation, so sunny of temper and full of human kindness, that
they are a constant inspiration and joy to us. Yet theirs is a hard
struggle, to remain true and sweet and Christian with such fearful
odds against them in the journey of life."</p>

<p><i>March 13.</i> To-day is my forty-sixth birthday, and I am about
ready, or rather have resolved, to open a Circulating Library in
the church, as quite a number are in favor of it. We organized our
Women's Auxiliary Conference last Tuesday, of a rainy day: Mrs.
Fayette Smith, President; Mrs. Alice Williams Brotherton,
Vice-president; Fannie Field, Treasurer and Recording Secretary;
Miss Ellis, Corresponding Secretary; Executive Committee (with the
above), Mrs. Davies Wilson, Miss Elizabeth D. Allen.</p></blockquote>

<p>The foundation of the Circulating Library was Miss Ellis's own
collection of religious books. Book lovers know what this sacrifice
would have been to a less generous nature, one less intent on helping
others. Additions were made by gifts from individuals and authors, and
by Miss Ellis's occasional purchase of some book whose need she felt,
until the library now numbers over one hundred and thirty volumes. These
books were loaned at church, and by mail all over the country.</p>

<p>A letter to Rev. A. A. Livermore reveals the brisk, happy, and
business-like Miss Ellis of the later years, with her hands at last full
of work for her denomination. It also records the advent of her first
correspondent, Mr. Julius Woodruff.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p class="right"><span class="smcap">March 10, 1881.</span></p>

<p>I have been better in health this winter than for many years,&mdash;for
a severe winter is all the better for me,&mdash;and have been able to
keep <i>very</i> busy. Mr. Wendte has made me chairman of a Book and
Tract Table in the church, which has kept me very busy; and in
addition, the Unity Club made me Corresponding Secretary of their
Sunday Afternoon Lecture Committee, which involved distributing the
tickets (one thousand) and then collecting the money on them.... In
the mean time, too, I was agent here for the "Register," had that
to attend to, besides attending to sale of books, paying for them,
and sending new orders, also "Unity" subscribers coming in, and
hunting up members for the Women's Auxiliary Conference, and
receiving their money. Now, do you not think for one who has always
been more spiritually inclined, that I have taken quite <i>too</i> much
to money matters?</p>

<p>Well, in distributing "Registers" through the State I have come
across a very interesting, appreciative young man of twenty-one, in
Ravenna, Ohio, and I have reason to think we have created quite a
stir in the little town. Mr. Woodruff, my correspondent, writes a
very good letter, and is quite enthusiastic on the subject of
Unitarianism, and is willing to do missionary work, distributing
widely the documents I send him, and has recommended a young man,
formerly a student of theology, an intelligent, thinking man, who
is much interested in our views. He now works on a farm and teaches
school, in order to gain an education.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> On Wednesday last we
organized our Women's Auxiliary Conference, at which I read Mr.
Woodruff's letters, and the ladies at once moved that we should
propose Meadville to our young friend, whose name is &mdash;&mdash;. I am to
write and ask whether he would like to go to the college at
Meadville, and in the mean time am to find out through you the
conditions on which he could be admitted. I should be only too
happy if I prove the means of assisting one young man to the
ministry, and shall feel that all these many years of interest in
the church have not been lost, if we only succeed in doing this
much good. Besides all this other work, I find the ladies are much
in favor of a Circulating Library in the church, so I am going to
found my library soon.</p></blockquote>

<p>The journal, March 20, shows the indomitable will that ruled the feeble
body:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Yesterday [Saturday] I was at the church all day to get the library
in order. Was taken with vertigo, and for over an hour and a half
couldn't walk straight. J&mdash;&mdash; S&mdash;&mdash; happened to be at the church at
choir-meeting, and brought me home. By bedtime could walk alone,
and to-day have been attending to duties at church. Succeeded in
getting the Library settled to my satisfaction, and was glad there
was no one there. Opened my library March 19. Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;announced me
"Miss Sarah Ellis" in the papers.</p>

<p><i>March 28.</i> Have felt quite encouraged this week by applications
for documents. Have just mailed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> Rev. &mdash;&mdash;, "Statement of
Unitarian Belief in Bible Language." [This applicant is now in a
Unitarian pulpit.]</p>

<p><i>April 3.</i> A beautiful sermon in "Register" to-day&mdash;"Life's
Shadows"&mdash;by Rev. J. Ll. Jones. [She copies two pages.]</p>

<p><i>May 1.</i> Feel deeply interested in a correspondent we have in
Springfield, ... who confesses himself something of an atheist, and
I am hunting up all the convincing articles upon the subject of God
and Immortality that I can find, and came across a "Unitarian
Review," of June, 1876, which seems to have been written for his
very case.... Hope these will be convincing to the Springfield
Club, which was formed last Sunday, with ten members to begin with.</p>

<p><i>June 2.</i> Am now quite interested in trying to manage it so as to
keep the church open two hours Sundays during the vacation, for
persons to come and read and take home books. Hope I may succeed.</p>

<p><i>June 12.</i> Have felt tired to-day, but enjoyed the day, for Mr.
Wendte and mother dined here. He tells me I may "run the church"
during the vacation, which will make me very happy.</p>

<p><i>June 29.</i> The hottest day of the month for ten years, and the
hottest of the season so far. Intense. One hundred in the shade at
noon. Have been reading W. R. Alger's "School of Life," from which
the following abstract....</p></blockquote>

<p>Then follow three pages of the "abstract," in a close, minute
handwriting, ending this volume of the journal,&mdash;the last submitted to
the writer's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> inspection, because, as has been previously said, there
was almost no personal matter in the diaries of the remaining years.</p>

<p>Miss Ellis's ardent desire to keep the church open during the summer
vacation had to be abandoned, owing to the reluctance of her family to
have one so feeble at the church alone; and she went Saturday afternoons
instead, when the sexton was there.</p>

<p>The Cincinnati branch of the Women's Auxiliary Conference, on its
organization in March, 1881, looking about for work to do, remembered
occasional letters received by Mr. Wendte in response to the documents
sent out by him and Miss Ellis. These letters seemed to hint at a
possible opportunity awaiting this Unitarian church, standing so
isolated in the heart of the great rich West, where the multitude of
Ingersoll and Liberal clubs, and of intelligent people outside all
churches, seemed to indicate a want that the evangelical denominations
did not meet. It was therefore resolved to attempt extending the work
begun by Mr. Wendte, by advertising in the daily papers Unitarian
literature for free distribution,&mdash;an experiment never before tried.
Miss Ellis entered upon her duties as Corresponding Secretary "without
money and without price" (though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> later a small annual salary of one
hundred dollars was raised for her), but with an immense zeal. The
advertisement's line or two of fine print, almost lost, apparently, on
the broad side of the daily paper, inserted only once a week,
nevertheless soon began to bring Miss Ellis letters that equally
surprised and delighted us, showing that we had not over-estimated the
demand for Unitarian literature in the West.</p>

<p>Rev. J. Ll. Jones being in Cincinnati, the first bundle of letters was
read to him, and his opinion, as an experienced Western missionary,
anxiously awaited. It was given in these words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I think you Cincinnati women have got hold of the <i>little end</i> of
a <i>big thing</i>, and if Miss Ellis's health and your enthusiasm hold
out, something is bound to come of it. Go on, by all means." He
added, "I wish I knew that Miss Ellis had ten years more to live."</p></blockquote>

<p>Four years and a half, however, was the short term of service allowed
her in her mission, found at last after years of longing and groping
towards it vainly. But now it was seen that all these years of suffering
had not been in vain. She who had endured so much was quick to
sympathize with others. The religious studies undertaken for her own
consolation enabled her wisely to direct the reading of her
correspondents.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> Even her deafness seemed specially to fit her for her
work. Shut apart from the din and bustle of modern life in a quiet world
of her own, from its peaceful communings she sent out light and strength
to others. The poor, denied life, like a plant severely pruned by the
careful gardener to insure a late, full bloom, now reached out and
touched many lives with a wonderful uplifting power.</p>

<p>Her records of this four and a half years' work show that she received
1,672 letters and postals, wrote 2,541, distributed at church and by
mail 22,042 tracts, papers, etc.; sold 286 books, loaned 258 books, and
obtained about sixty subscribers to religious papers.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Mere figures,
however, but poorly tell the story. Several young men have entered or
will enter the ministry, as one result of her efforts. Many souls
wrestling in utter loneliness with doubts they dared not confide to
their nearest friends, received, from her wise sympathy and counsel,
restoration to religious faith, and strength to bear heavy burdens with
renewed courage, animated by trust in a loving Father hitherto concealed
from them behind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> outgrown phraseology of antiquated creeds,&mdash;creeds
which their reason rejected. Many, indeed most of these correspondents,
overjoyed with their new faith, hastened to share it with friends, and
many a little missionary centre began to grow in localities far from any
Unitarian church, fostered by people who had never heard a Unitarian
sermon. So the ground was being prepared for the State missionary. Her
work, too, opened the eyes of her denomination to its opportunities, and
did much to promote that missionary activity in which lies our brightest
hope for the future. She is the acknowledged pioneer of the Post Office
Mission.</p>

<p>As her work began to attract attention, many letters came from those
desiring to undertake like work, both East and West, asking advice, full
and explicit accounts of her methods, etc.; and many long letters were
written in reply. A Unitarian Club formed among the soldiers in the
Columbus barracks was one of her interests, until its dissolution by the
ordering of its members to other posts. She supplied much reading matter
to, and corresponded occasionally with, soldiers at the Dayton Soldiers'
Home. A soldier in Wyoming Territory was for a long time a most grateful
recipient of reading from her, which he shared with his company. Small
clubs in several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> localities were supplied by her with matter for
discussion and study during their existence. Wherever she had two or
three correspondents, she always urged the formation of reading or Unity
clubs. For some months she had an interesting correspondence with a
young man of more than usual intelligence in our City Workhouse, loaning
him such books as Channing's "Life and Works," Dewey's "Human Nature,"
and Merriam's "Way of Life." She never heard from him after he left the
workhouse, but always had faith that he was somewhere living up to, or
towards, the good resolves so often expressed to her. Through him, and
Mr. Beach, of Joliet, Ill., our attention was called to the need of
supplying prisoners with good reading matter, both religious and
secular. Correspondence was opened with the warden and chaplain at the
State Penitentiary, Frankfort, Ky., which led to the sending of their
"Registers" there regularly by two Boston ladies, and eventually to the
sending of many barrels of reading matter both to Joliet and Kentucky by
the Women's Auxiliary Conference of Boston.</p>

<p>A great pleasure of her last years was attending the Western Conference
at Chicago in May, 1883. Published accounts of her work had made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> her
well known in the denomination; so that, as the Cincinnati party
reported on their return home, "Miss Ellis was decidedly the belle of
the Conference." Every one wanted to see and talk with her, ask her
advice, etc. It was an immense satisfaction to her to meet personally,
to see and hear (for she almost seemed to hear through the eager eyes),
men and women whose fame and writings were so familiar to her. Every
session of the Conference saw Miss Ellis seated in the front pew,
audiphone in hand, eagerly intent on the exercises. Social beguilements
might make other people late at the morning devotions, but never Miss
Ellis, who took her conferences, like all else, conscientiously.</p>

<p>In May, 1885, she again attended the Western Conference at St. Louis,
though in great feebleness of body. Rev. W. C. Gannett, in "Unity," thus
speaks of her:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"A last summer's letter from the little mother of the Post Office
Mission, who has just died in Cincinnati, will be of interest now.
Some who were present at the last May Conference in St. Louis may
remember the pathos of the quiet figure sitting in the front pews
and trying on her echo-fan to catch the patter of the words said
round her. The wee, sick, deafened body in which she did her work
so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> strong-heartedly makes that work all the more an example and an
inspiration. Strange enough should it prove that this bit of a
lady, almost caged from the world by cripplings, had opened the
most effective channel yet made for carrying our liberal faith to
the world. Perhaps it <i>takes</i> a thorn in the flesh to make a
missionary. She certainly has done more than many a stout <i>son</i> of
the Gospel to keep her name remembered in our Western churches.
This letter hints her pluck and her joy in the work, and the
struggle of it. She had been urged to go into the country for a
short rest, but replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>The country is not the place for me to stay in any time. The
morning and evening air keep my head roaring so, and increase
catarrh. I have learned that to stay home during the summer, make
no special effort, and work on slowly, is the better plan. If I go
away, there is constantly an effort over something. I return tired,
work has accumulated. I have to work doubly hard, and soon use up
the little gained. I am too weak in summer to wish to come in
contact with people to whom I have to be agreeable. Another
difficulty,&mdash;the country is too <i>quiet</i> for me. I am inclined to be
a "hermit," and when I do go out, which I do daily, even now I am
so sick, I need the stir, bustle, commotion, and the stores to
change the thoughts. I loved the country before I was so deaf,&mdash;now
city life is better for me; but I love to refresh myself by a ride
into the country in the street cars, where I can study <i>human</i>
nature on the way.... I work on principle, and for the real love of
working. I am not happy unless at work, and can't bear to tear
myself away from my little congregation, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> papers, books, etc.
<i>They</i> suffer for it. The family do not wish me to keep so busy,
but I am better for it, and my physician is on my side. "Keep up!"
[The next few sentences have already been given, in reference to
Mr. Noyes.] Don't give me undue credit for my appearance at the St.
Louis Conference. I tried to kill three birds with one stone (I
don't wear bird's wings in my hat, however),&mdash;to attend the
Conference, visit a brother, and gain strength. The last I failed
in.... I have written this long letter in two sittings. I have
improved decidedly within the past few days, and with pleasant
rides and good food and care shall soon be better. Most sincerely
and cordially your friend, </p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Sallie Ellis.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cincinnati</span>, July 28,1885."</p></blockquote>

<p>Strangely enough, one's first thought of Miss Ellis was never as an
invalid. She so ignored the poor, weak body that she made you forget it
too. She was always so <i>alive</i>, so full of interest and joy in her work.
With what delight would she say, "This new tract is exactly the thing to
send &mdash;&mdash;," or announce, "such a good letter from &mdash;&mdash;." Even during the
last months, when the ravages of disease could no longer be concealed,
she <i>would</i> not be sick. She set aside your sympathy. She was always
"better," "only my limbs are so weak to-day," or "my breath is so
short," or "it always makes me cough to walk," as if these were mere
casual incidents quite unworthy of notice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>The last of her life, it was pitiful to see her still clinging to her
work, still persisting in caring for her own room, declining all offers
of help. She often rose at five o'clock Sundays, because obliged by
weakness to work slowly, that she might reach church early, to prepare
her Tract Table before the congregation arrived. When no longer able to
remain to the services, she still came and ministered to her own special
congregation at the Tract Table, though obliged by weakness to sit. When
she no longer had strength to arrange her hair, she quietly cut it off.
But she went on with her work. To one offering help she said, "When I
cannot do my work, I don't want to live." Again, she said, "There are
many who need me, and they keep me alive." To the last she declined
being considered an invalid,&mdash;did not wish any one to walk out with her,
although the family were very uneasy to have one so weak and so deaf on
the street alone. She walked out every day, until the last time she was
forced to lean against the door-post and gain breath and strength to
take the final step up into the house.</p>

<p>All this time she was writing letters of cheer and strength, seldom
intimating that all was not well with her. When finally obliged to keep
her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> bed, she faded away rapidly, only living about two weeks. The last
postal card to a correspondent was begun in bed, in a trembling hand,
ending abruptly, "Too sick to write," and it was finished for her.
Although at times she had a little of the consumptive's feeling that she
might possibly rally, and even recover strength to work again, yet she
perceived, as she said to her mother, that "the sands are running out
fast," and made all her preparations for death in the quiet spirit of
one merely going on a journey into a familiar country. One who watched
with her one of the last nights spoke of a beautiful prayer she offered
in the middle of the night. She was unable to turn herself in bed, and
said to this friend with a smile, "This body wants turning so." Poor
body! not much longer had she to endure its weaknesses. Her religion was
too habitual, too much a part of her very soul, for many outward words
or professions. It was her life, her self. Why should she talk about it?</p>

<p>Mr. Thayer had always given her a list of the hymns and the full order
of service, and the sermon to read. The Sunday before her death the
sermon was returned, with the message that Miss Ellis was unable to read
it, but had asked her mother to copy the text for her. A week before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
her death a friend, finding that in her excessive conscientiousness she
was letting business details of the Women's Auxiliary Conference trouble
her lest she should forget some item, went over all the books, wrote
business letters, and settled accounts, at her dictation. Speaking of
her work, she expressed faith that "God will raise up some one to do
it." She said earnestly, "I have always wanted to do something for my
denomination." It had evidently been a little of a struggle for her to
leave the work she loved, just as it began to be so successful in many
places, to die and be forgotten. In her modesty, she had no foregleam of
the afterglow of praise and public testimony to her worth that was to
follow the setting of her sun. Speaking once, near the end, with great
pleasure, of Mrs. Paine's successful work in Newport and New York, she
added, sadly, "They must increase, but I must decrease." But at last she
was "ready not to do," able to give all up and repose in perfect peace
upon the Father.</p>

<p>She had always thought much of Christmas, always remembered her friends'
birthdays. Her skilful fingers and untiring industry made the slender
means go a long way in devising innumerable tasteful presents on these
days for a large circle of friends. She loved children, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> loved to
make them happy, and her little friends were always remembered. This
year, a day or two before Christmas, when so weak that only by the
closest attention could the feeble, broken utterance be understood, she
directed Christmas gifts, prepared long before, sent to all her friends.
To one whom she knew needed it, went "Daily Strength for Daily Needs;"
to one, a teacher, the little "Seed Thoughts from Browning." "I thought
it might help her in her work, tell her." Even her washerwoman and her
little girl, and the postman,&mdash;"he has brought me a great many letters,"
she said,&mdash;were not forgotten.</p>

<p>A friend took her a Christmas card sent by a little girl. Her feeble
vision could barely discern the design. "Birds and flowers," she said;
"what could be more beautiful? It cheers me so. Yet I hardly need that.
I am very happy and cheerful. I feel that everything is right."
Afterwards she spoke of the "Happy, happy Christmas-tide," saying, "We
must try to make it bright for the young." To the last, her thoughts
were of others.</p>

<p>Having closed all her earthly affairs, she lay awaiting the end in great
peace. Sunday, Dec. 27, 1885, in the evening of the peaceful day she
always loved, just as her little clock was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> striking seven, she passed
gently away in sleep. Well may we believe that hers was a joyful
wakening into a bright New Year.</p>

<p>Her funeral was attended in the Unitarian Church, December 30,&mdash;a
service of rare beauty and appropriateness. A thoughtful friend had
covered the Tract Table in the vestibule with moss, ferns, and flowers,
among which were placed a few tracts. In the church, wreathed with
Christmas evergreens, a large concourse of friends assembled. To the
strains of the Beethoven Funeral March, the coffin, nearly concealed
beneath emblematic palm branches and lilies, was borne by the brothers
whose loving-kindness had brightened all the life now ended, to its
resting-place beneath the pulpit, close to the front seat where, for so
many years, Miss Ellis's familiar form had never been missing. The
choir, composed of young friends of hers in the church, sang the first
three verses of "Nearer, my God, to Thee," and Whittier's appropriate
hymn, "Another hand is beckoning us."</p>

<p>From the text, "She is not dead, but sleepeth," Rev. George A. Thayer
paid a just and beautiful tribute to the spirit passed from our midst.
To few, he said, could these words of Jesus be so fittingly applied.
Though seemingly dead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> she would live in ever-increasing power in the
influence she had exerted over other lives. If, from cities and villages
far away, from lonely farm-houses, all could to-day be assembled within
these walls who had received help and strength from her, large indeed
would be the concourse. More truly of her than of most might it be said
that she had</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"joined the choir invisible<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of those immortal dead who live again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In minds made better by their presence."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It would be well could we all imitate her example in cultivating a love
of religious reading, and that habit of religious meditation and
communion which was the source of her strength. Her leading
characteristic was conscience, an all-dominating power of conscience.
Whatever she felt it her duty to do, that she did, at all costs. He
closed by reading Bryant's</p>

<p>On the pleasant slope of a lovely hillside in Spring Grove, where
everything around breathes of Nature's peace and repose, among graves
very dear to her, the worn body was laid to rest, while the gentle
winter rain fell not unkindly into the open grave. Much seemed to have
gone out of the world when the echoing clods covered that which was
"Miss Ellis."</p>

<p>The Sunday after her death, as some of her friends were sadly trying to
replace the tracts in the table drawer just as she would have liked them
arranged, a white dove flew down and rested on the window-sill outside.
Only a coincidence, but one that touched us, nevertheless. If the
spirits of the departed ever revisit earth, surely Miss Ellis would
return to the church she loved so much; and possibly it is not wholly
fancy that still feels her in her old-time seat under the pulpit.</p>

<p>As soon as possible after Miss Ellis's death the Women's Auxiliary
Conference of Cincinnati<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> prepared a four-page leaflet, containing a
brief sketch of her life and death, and sent it to all her
correspondents, many of whom were ignorant that she was even in ill
health. The little memorial's first page reads:&mdash;</p>

<p>The memorial closed as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"At the regular monthly meeting of the Women's Auxiliary Conference
of Cincinnati, Jan. 12, 1886, the programme for this meeting was
omitted, and the afternoon devoted to tender recollection of the
dear friend and valued secretary so recently taken from us, to the
reading of many letters from East and West containing loving
tribute to her worth and sympathy for our loss, and to devising
such plans for continuing our work in future as should be our
friend's best commemoration, the tribute she would chiefly have
desired. Mrs. George A. Thayer offered the following expression of
the feeling of our Society, for entry on our records:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'It is fitting that we should place upon the records of this
Association some words of grateful remembrance of our late
fellow-worker and Secretary, Sallie Ellis, who went up higher on
Sunday, Dec. 27, 1885.</p>

<p>"'She was called to her office four years and a half ago, and took
up its work from the beginning as one who felt its consecration,
and saw the opportunity it offered of being a ministry of the
highest things to many souls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> yearning for a word of religion both
reasonable and spiritual.</p>

<p>"'Her long and loving study of Unitarian principles gave her a rare
fitness for teaching others the <i>thought</i> of our church. Her
personal faith in the deep things of God enabled her to speak ever
the needed word to inquirers of the <i>religion</i> of our church. And
her sacred sense of duty, not only illustrated in every act of her
life, but shining always through her written words, made her an
admirable exemplar of the <i>moral quality</i> of our church. So she was
all that we could ask as our missionary leader, for she not only
taught the stranger from afar of the surpassing beauty and
greatness of our Liberal Christianity, but she quickened in us at
home new love for its truths, and a deeper sense of our privilege
and obligations in being of its disciples.</p>

<p>"'In her life she guided and inspired us, and being dead she abides
with us, ever a constant presence, to make us humble that we do so
little for our great work, and to stir in us desire to be more
faithful to our task in the Master's vineyard.'</p>

<p>"The following extract from a letter of directions left by Miss Ellis in
the event of her death was then read:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'All the books in the loan library I bequeath to the use of the
church, and when not so used, my family shall have the disposal of
them.'</p>

<p>"This library comprises over one hundred and thirty religious books,
chiefly by Unitarian authors. It was voted that this library 'shall
always be known as The Sallie Ellis Loan Library.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mrs. M. E. Hunert, 177 Betts Street, Cincinnati, was appointed
Corresponding Secretary. All communications may hereafter be addressed
to her. She will continue the free distribution of Unitarian papers,
tracts, and sermons, to any names furnished her of persons desiring
them. She will also receive subscriptions for Unitarian publications and
sell books, when desired, and will loan the books of the Sallie Ellis
Loan Library, the borrower paying the postage only. It is earnestly
wished to continue Miss Ellis's work in her spirit, and it is hoped
correspondents and friends will co-operate with us in this effort.</p>

<p>"Though saddened and greatly bereft, the Cincinnati Auxiliary would
still strive to 'look forward and not back,' working on in the spirit of
Whittier's poem,</p>

<p>The "In Memoriam" called out letters of deep regret&mdash;the regret of those
who mourn a personal friend&mdash;from every correspondent. A few of these
letters appear in the correspondence, selected from many of similar
tenor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CORRESPONDENCE" id="CORRESPONDENCE"></a>CORRESPONDENCE.</h2>

<p>The letters of Miss Ellis's correspondents here given are selected from
an immense number of like purport and interest. She had kept all the
significant letters neatly filed in bundles, each correspondent by
himself. It has been a disappointment to receive so few, comparatively,
of her own letters. Our busy age is not given to saving its letters. It
is therefore all the more touching to know that so many of her
correspondents have treasured even every postal card from her hand. Her
letters given here, however, well illustrate her spirit and ideas on
many topics, also her method of work, and reveal something of the secret
of her success.</p>

<p>Literary style and fine effects were the last things aimed at in her
letters. Their characteristics are plainness, directness, intense
earnestness to convince and impress, and a warm sympathy with people of
all kinds and degrees. Strongly conservative in her own theology, she
yet did not set up her views as a fixed standard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> for others, or assume
to hold all truth. Some of her warmest friends were among our younger,
more radical ministers, whose purity and sincerity of life and faith
quite offset in her eyes their theological vagaries.</p>

<p>The letters first given are to fellow-workers who had asked about her
methods, materials, etc. In an article which Mr. Gannett had asked her
to write, and which appeared in "Unity," March 1, 1884, she wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"We keep a standing weekly advertisement in two of our chief daily
papers,&mdash;those which have the widest circulation, one Saturday
morning, and the other Sunday, under the head of 'Religious
Notices.' One of these papers advertises free for us.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>"On receiving an application we respond, being guided somewhat by
the style and character of the application, by sending one or two
tracts, with a copy of the 'Christian Register' or 'Unity.' [Many
people of the church, after reading their religious papers, handed
them to Miss Ellis for distribution.] After sending the papers and
various tracts for several weeks, we write a postal of inquiry as
to whether Unitarian literature is satisfactory; and if the person
cares to subscribe to either of the papers, <i>which</i> he or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> she
prefers; which tracts have given the most satisfaction; and whether
they care to borrow any books by mail, paying the postage on them.
Frequently we receive no reply [in which case the name was
dropped], but mostly the answer is gratifying. If the person cannot
subscribe for the papers, but enjoys them, we continue to send
them.... In sending tracts, we begin with 'Unitarian Principles and
Doctrines,' by Rev. C. A. Brigham, the 'New Hampshire Statement of
Belief,' and 'What Do Unitarians Believe?' by Rev. C. W.
Wendte,&mdash;because we wish to show what our faith has grown from, and
what it is now. These we think fairly represent the denomination;
and we have found that they all give general satisfaction. Next,
'Why Am I a Unitarian?' by James F. Clarke, D.D., which is also
well liked, and 'Discourse on Distinguishing Opinions of
Unitarians,' by William E. Channing, D.D., as creating a thirst for
his 'Works.' Then we branch off from this into whatever we think
best.... <i>Promptness</i> in replying and <i>regularity</i> in sending
papers, etc., will do more towards showing our deep interest in the
work, and bring the individual seeking into vital connection with
the church sending the literature. A <i>little</i> at a time frequently,
to insure <i>careful</i> and <i>thorough</i> reading. Recommend books
extensively.... We believe in loaning the books of the early
ministers of our denomination as a good stepping-stone to the
Unitarianism now taught in our pulpits."</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>In a letter to Miss F. L. Roberts, of Chicago, then Secretary of Western
Women's Unitarian Conference, March 14, 1884, she wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I agree with you that no <i>one</i> tract or sermon will satisfy the
questions of inquirers. They have to 'grow into the light,' as we
all have done and still are doing. Did any one thing settle our
doubts or questionings? I think not.</p>

<p>"'What is our <i>aim</i> in the Post Office Mission Work?' It occurs to
me it should be to give inquirers the fairest statement of our
teachings, from Channing up to the present time. Not the thought of
any one man or woman, but that of the greatest number of our best
minds in the several eras of our denomination. In many cases ...
people have not the <i>slightest</i> idea what Unitarianism is, farther
than that we do not believe Christ was God. They not only do not
know what we believe, but think us a kind of 'outcasts.' It almost
seems like being in the Dark Ages of the world to hear of such
ignorance as we <i>know</i> exists with regard to our doctrines.
Therefore we are talking, as it were, to children. Let us then
begin at first principles, and send fair, clear statements."</p></blockquote>

<p>After alluding to several of her correspondents who were thinking of
entering the Unitarian ministry, she adds:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"It seems to me the A. U. A. tracts, and the books, papers, etc.,
sent with them, have produced good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> results; have made deep,
earnest thinkers. It is through these very things our own ministers
have been made to think, and they have gone beyond these same
things; and so will our correspondents in time. But at present few
of them have access to books, or come in contact with people who
can converse on all these points with them; therefore it is well to
intersperse with our tracts on doctrines, good <i>practical</i> sermons,
and the newer tracts occasionally, leading them up gradually to
Unitarian ideas, and showing them especially that while we <i>have</i>
doctrines in our church, character is the most important to us.
There is no one book that has done more effective work than Rev. J.
F. Clarke's 'Orthodoxy,' etc., which proves that we need good,
<i>clear</i>, strong doctrine. [The Post Office Mission, she adds] is
only a larger church, and we want to bring these people into vital
connection with us,&mdash;making not Unitarians of them, or merely
intellectual men and women, but practical Christians working with
us and for humanity. Rev. &mdash;&mdash; is the prophet of his age. We shall
all <i>grow</i> up to his ideal some day, and bring our Post Office
Mission members with us. Hope he will be willing to wait. 'It is
good that a man should both hope and quietly wait' (Lam. iii. 26)."</p></blockquote>

<p>A bit from another letter to Miss Roberts is interesting as showing the
untiring industry which enabled Miss Ellis to accomplish so much:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>... "Next week we hold our fair, and I shall be very busy all the
week. Have had so many orders for mittens, that I am a perfect
knitting machine. I can knit and read, however, and therefore have
looked over many sermons for distribution in the mean time. Am
tired, and thankful for the blessed Saturday night followed by the
quiet of Sunday."</p></blockquote>

<p>In answer to a letter of inquiry from Miss F. Le Baron when that lady
first entered on her work as Secretary of the Western Women's Unitarian
Conference at Chicago, Dec. 2, 1884, Miss Ellis wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"'How much time do you give to all this work?' Doing it at home, I
cannot calculate exactly, for there are many moments thrown in that
I cannot well count; but this much I <i>can</i> say. I begin about 9 <span class="smcap">A.
M.</span> Monday to collect my materials about me, and usually by
dinner-time (1 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>) I have put away all papers, etc., and have
ready my week's papers, etc., for the postman to take. Nearly every
evening I write an hour or more, excepting Sunday, when I won't
write business letters. This is all the work I can <i>calculate</i>; but
there are many moments spent reading my letters, assorting papers,
tying up books, setting down items, making purchases, etc., besides
the time spent Sunday and on Wednesday at the church, over the
library, etc. However, I am very systematic in everything, and
accomplish more in that way.... Of course, new applicants I reply
to at once; but every new applicant is then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> added to my Monday
list. Being at an office, you have more interruptions; and then
deafness has its reward, and one can pursue her work in peace many
times, whereas another would be disturbed."</p></blockquote>

<p>In answer to another letter from Miss Le Baron, full of warm
congratulations on her success, she writes, Dec. 11, 1884:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I am very much obliged for your high opinion of me. I read it to a
dear friend, who always sends me to the Conference at Chicago, and
she said, 'It's all true, but I hope you won't get so far above me
in the next world.' I never have stopped to 'understand' what I am
doing, or the 'name' I am making. To do the good comes from my
heart, and I leave the results to the Good Father, and know if I
merit a reward it will be given me. It is a pleasure in <i>this</i>
world, to feel I am giving satisfaction to so many in the
denomination. I am a thorough Unitarian, and have read our
denominational works more than anything else, which has prepared me
for this very work. I am an ignoramus in literature outside of
Unitarianism, only that you cannot be a Unitarian and not come,
more or less, in contact with general literature.... By the way, I
always read tracts, and M. J. Savage's and Chadwick's and Clarke's
weekly sermons, going to and from the city [Miss Ellis was living
at this time in Avondale, three miles from the city], and carry
<i>big</i> packages of papers home on Sunday. Think the conductors must
know I am a missionary."</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>Rev. Joseph May, Rev. Charles Allen, and Rev. F. L. Hosmer sent Miss
Ellis many of their printed sermons for distribution, which did good
service. Rev. William C. Gannett early saw the possibilities of this
work, and has done much to systematize and further it in many ways. He
christened it the "Post Office Mission," and, seeing the need of more
fresh material for distribution, devised and edited the "Church Door
Pulpit" series of sermons, and has also been the chief promoter of the
"Unity Mission" series of tracts. The following extracts are from Miss
Ellis's letters to him.</p>

<blockquote><p class="right"><span class="smcap">September 12, 1882.</span></p>

<p>Received to-day, from &mdash;&mdash;, your letter of September 5, asking
about our "Missionary Work by Letter." ... I will very gladly
afford you my assistance in that respect. However, I am rather more
conservative than yourself,&mdash;rather of the E. S. Gannett
type,&mdash;still have visited Omaha, where I have had brothers settled,
and know some little of the style of religion which is requisite in
the Northwest.... Will give you a list of the tracts I have used
most profitably. Most people state, when they ask for literature,
"Want something that teaches the <i>doctrines</i> of the Unitarian
Church." Thereupon I have forwarded, from time to time, "Unitarian
Doctrines and Principles" (Brigham); "Word of God" and "The Rising
Star of the Liberal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> Faith" (W. P. Tilden); "New Hampshire
Statement of Belief;" "Unitarian Belief in Bible Language;" "Why Am
I a Unitarian?" "Inspiration of New Testament," "Revivals"
(Clarke); "Our Common Christianity" (A. P. Stanley); "Mission of
Unitarianism" (Heber Newton); "Spiritual Christianity." (Starr
King); and "What Do Unitarians Believe?" (C. W. Wendte).... The
serial sermons of Chadwick, Clarke, Hale, and Savage always gladly
received.... But do not be afraid of a little doctrine, Mr.
Gannett, for there are some people in Orthodox churches who are
hungering and thirsting for just our doctrines. They cannot do
without doctrine just yet, but want something better than they have
known, and think it a great blessing to find it. I try my
congregation to see what each requires, and lead them on and up. My
church is composed of a very mixed set.... I am deeply interested
in this work, and know we have done much good.... We keep books to
loan, and also recommend books from time to time, and ask our
correspondents to subscribe to the periodicals.... Dr. Dewey's
sermons on "Human Nature" and "Human Life," and his "Two Great
Commandments" benefit some people very much.</p></blockquote>

<p>I never omit the "Pulpit" column [of the Register], and read
"Wrestling and Blessing" with much interest.... I set each
difficulty down as just suited for some one, or two, or three of my
correspondents. Of course, I <i>don't apply sermons to myself any
more</i>. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> a beautiful sermon; and this brings me to the point
we are all so interested in,&mdash;the wider circulation of the fresh
thoughts of all the pulpits. I surely think, with you, that it will
help the work to "give it name." Am glad you are stirring them all
up. I do not, as you say, feel the need of it so much, but
occasionally do.... A new case in Tennessee, who never knew
<i>anything</i> of the Liberal Church, till we sent him papers. Is much
pleased, and wants to read till he knows still more about us. He
writes, "Not one per cent of the people here know there is such a
church. Tell me, do the majority of Unitarian ministers believe in
the resurrection of Jesus; that he healed the leper, cast out
devils, and raised Lazarus? I ask for information, and hope you
will reply at some future time." He is evidently in a benighted
region. Says he has "heard nothing outside the Cumberland
Presbyterian, Baptist, and Methodist Churches, and am none of
these;" and I presume is very little of anything yet, and is
longing for a nobler life than he has known, or sees about him. The
longer I go on, the more need I see of getting this work fully and
well organized. It will be brought about ere long. Even reading
over papers is beneficial. The publication of our hymns, the most
inspiring, will do a great deal of good. In several cases I have
copied them, and to good purpose.</p></blockquote>

<p>Jan. 20, 1885, in answer to the question, what twenty names she would
prefer in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> "Church Door Pulpit" series the coming year, she wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Revs. Grindall Reynolds, Rush R. Shippen, J. F. Clarke, E. E.

afraid I haven't left any room for those who do not bear the
'Unitarian' name, but feel that Unitarianism is so little known,
that I would first make our own best writers known, and then branch
out and take in others. All of the above names I should like to see
in 'Church Door Pulpit' for 1885-1886.... I think generally people
wish to become acquainted with the Unitarian pulpit. 'What do
Unitarians preach?' is the cry. 'I want to hear a Unitarian;'
'those who have been educated in that denomination.'"</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p class="right"><span class="smcap">February 20, 1885.</span></p>

<p>Your article in "Unity," February 16, on "A Blessing on the Day,"
pleased me very much.... We haven't quite the right book yet, and
with you I say, "about twelve verses from the Bible well knitted
around some central thought," as we principally want to become
acquainted with the Bible as the "Book of man." Think something
more like "Daily Praise and Prayer," with different Scripture
selections, perhaps, and omitting most of the prayers. I would only
have a prayer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> to lead to a prayer of one's own,&mdash;that is, to
inspire one to pray in their own words. Have often thought I should
like to compile a book of "Daily Worship" from the Scriptures, our
Hymn Books, "Daily Praise and Prayer," "Day unto Day," "Helps to
Devout Living," and the "Responsive Service," and now, from "Daily
Strength for Daily Needs," "Aspirations of the World," and
"Spiritual Life" in the "Register," but principally Scripture
selections.... "Daily Praise and Prayer" is doing much good in a
very troublesome family of one of my correspondents. I remembered
to have sent the lady "Wrestling and Blessing," and wrote a short
time since to call her attention to the "Inherited Burden," asking
if she still had the tract. This morning received a reply, in which
she wrote, "Yes! I still have 'Wrestling and Blessing,' for it did
me so much good when I first read it that I felt as if I could not
part with it." Many, many homes need "A Blessing on the Day" to
create the true feeling.</p></blockquote>

<p>To Miss Holmes, of the Davenport, Iowa, Post Office Mission, Miss Ellis
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="right"><span class="smcap">August 20, 1884.</span></p>

<p>... Yes, I do use the A. U. A. tracts freely, and more than any
others, those marked on our list herein enclosed, and also "Word of
God," "The Doctrine of Prayer," and "Wrestling and Blessing,"&mdash;the
latter to those who need encouragement particularly. I find
generally that people want to get at the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> principles,&mdash;the A
B C of Unitarianism. We do not use Higginson's "Sympathy of
Religion" at all. Our aim is to make practical Unitarians, and let
doctrines and theory gradually fall into the secondary place.
Therefore I object to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s list of books, because they are
more historical and theoretical. They do well where one wants to
study religion; but where one wants a Christianity to live by, I
think something that comes down to practical life, or that is more
simple, better adapted to the generality of people. As knowledge of
Unitarianism spreads, they will naturally seek deeper works. But at
present, something as clear and concise as possible, with the
"Christian Register," "Unity," and the "Dayspring," which further
illustrate our principles, we find very popular. The difficulty is
to get a large enough supply and variety enough. The A. U. A.
tracts only answer as an explanation, and we must have the sermons,
and papers, and books enough in addition. As I have been at the
work for three years, it is hard work to find sufficient supplies
for between thirty and forty every week, and these extending the
papers and tracts elsewhere.</p>

<p>I cannot think, with Mr. Judy, that it is the best method to divide
the work. It seems to me that causes confusion. It seems a much
better way that the person who sends the tracts and papers should
distribute the books too, as being better able to advise the books
to read; for he or she learns the "bent of mind" of the seeker. So
many different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> persons at work causes confusion and mistakes. I
mail papers, tracts, etc., attend to all the correspondence, to
loaning and mailing the books, to all printed matter received, to
all the advertising orders of every kind, to money received and
expended,&mdash;consulting the President frequently, and the details are
brought up before our monthly meetings. I do not believe the work
can be so well done as by one person; but of course no one could
devote so much time to it unless they have some compensation for
it. I took up the work at first voluntarily, but soon found there
was a great deal in it, and therefore wished to give it earnest
attention, and the ladies felt me particularly fitted for it, and
preferred to give me a small salary. It never is "irksome" to me,
but a work of real love to me. I have always been a
missionary,&mdash;distributing all the papers and tracts which contained
anything of a practical nature or of a pure Christianity.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p class="center"><i>To Miss Holmes.</i></p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">August 29, 1884.</span></p>

<p>Have just been re-reading "A Little Pilgrim." To tell you the plain
truth, the ideas are beautiful, but I do not like prying into the
next world. No one really knows anything concerning it. I am
willing to rest where Jesus left us. He told us little of it, but
enough for the "health of our souls." "In our Father's house are
many mansions. I go to prepare a place for you;" and I believe when
our friends leave us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> they go to another division of God's kingdom
and "prepare a place for us," in that through their deaths we are
naturally drawn heavenward, and our lives are different from ever
before. I am not so much interested as to what the future world is.
It is enough to me, to know that it is, and that I am doing the
best I can while I am living here. The future world will be made
plain to me when my time comes to go there; and if I have only
lived rightly here, there will be nothing to fear.</p>

<p>I can trust in God. Still such books seem to be necessary to some
persons, but I do not consider them healthy reading. When you have
finished such a book the query comes, "Is it fact?" Who can say it
is? I feel that my friends are in the hands of a loving Father as
they were while on earth, and that he will still do for them what
is best, and their spirit and affection remain with us to comfort
and guide us. I never lose them. They are only "gone before."</p></blockquote>

postscripts, contained the best part of the letter&mdash;till a month
afterwards, when in house-cleaning I was assorting letters
received, I noticed the last page of your letter, which was like
receiving a new letter, and came in very opportune; for we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
had so much to depress us of late, that I was glad to have my
attention called to Philippians, which contains so much that is
cheering. There has been a good deal to occupy my time and thoughts
since your very kind letter reached me; but I will not allow your
college term to close without sending you my kind word, though I
cannot be personally present at the Ohio Conference and Meadville
exercises. May you have charming weather, and a satisfactory
gathering, is my sincere wish. Rev. William H. Channing's visit
here was highly appreciated by his old friends and the early
members of the church, and we all particularly enjoyed the
Communion. It was truly a communion with the departed, and very
beautiful to us. I did not have the pleasure of meeting Mr.
Channing excepting a few moments at Mrs. Ryland's, which I
regretted exceedingly; but it was a disappointment I could not
alter.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; and wife moved to Mt. Auburn to-day, there to make a bright,
beautiful home for themselves, which is as it should be; but we who
are left at home feel rather sad. The last of my dear mother's five
little children has gone from me, and it is not so easy to enter
into their homes and have my brothers and sisters what they were to
me in our own family circle. Still all is right and best as it is;
and though clouds gather over our heads, the sunshine will at
length make itself seen, for "all things work together for good." I
am going to be gay and spend the summer with &mdash;&mdash; in Philadelphia;

summer together.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<blockquote><p class="right"><span class="smcap">October 1, 1884.</span></p>

<p>... Thanks for your kind sympathy for us in our sorrow. Thanks to
you for the solid foundation you laid when our dear mother died,
which has given me a firm faith in the hour of trial. I firmly
believe that "all things work together for good," and that dear
C&mdash;&mdash;'s long sickness prepared her family, herself, and all of us
for her death. There was much in her sickness and death that was
beautiful and comforting. It was pleasant after so many days of
suffering to see her at rest; and we feel it must have been a happy
release to her too, for her face in death bore no trace of the pain
she had endured, of which we were glad, for she looked so natural
and sweetly that we could allow her two youngest children to look
at "mamma asleep, to wake up an angel in heaven." C&mdash;&mdash; never
wanted her children to have a horror of death, and her desire has
been granted. They have no other idea than that the Good Father
released their dear mother from pain and she is an angel in heaven.
An Episcopalian minister officiated at the funeral, as C&mdash;&mdash; always
preferred that service. He was a personal friend of hers and my
brother E&mdash;&mdash;'s. My brother's widow came from &mdash;&mdash;to attend the
funeral, and she requested that I select a piece to be read in case
they found no one to lead in a hymn. I selected your hymn,&mdash;"A holy
air is breathing round." It was read in the middle of the service,
very impressively, and was particularly comforting to N&mdash;&mdash;'s widow
and myself, as you had officiated at our mother's funeral and had
baptized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> C&mdash;&mdash; and N&mdash;&mdash;. (Do you remember the day you baptized me
and my three brothers and C&mdash;&mdash; at the Masonic Hall?) The children
scattered flowers over the graves; A&mdash;&mdash;, ten years old, said on
returning from the cemetery, "Papa, it was all beautiful, no dread
or gloom about it. It was just as mamma would have had it." And so
it was. The children will always feel the life hereafter a reality.
"More homelike is the vast unknown," since their mamma is there.
The piece "At noontide," in last week's "Register," applies to dear
C&mdash;&mdash;'s death as well as if written for her. It is beautiful. I
want it in a leaflet to distribute, as I have opportunity
frequently for just such words. Yes! I help on "Unity," the
"Register," and "Our Best Words."... Hope I am making Christians,
and not merely Liberals or merely Unitarians. Think we are gaining
ground with many; but the literature must be distributed with great
care, I feel with you.... We are glad to have the Thayers home
again, and will probably begin to work earnestly next week.</p></blockquote>

nearer than Mr. Barnes of Montreal.... Unity Club flourishes, so

pleasant holidays at Meadville. I must close to write to Aunt &mdash;&mdash;,
who always looks for a Sunday letter from me. [This was an aged
blind aunt.]</p></blockquote>

<p>Miss Ellis's first Post Office Mission correspondent was a young man in
Ravenna, Ohio, Mr. Julius Woodruff. His first letter to her said:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Thank you for your kindness in sending me the 'Christian
Register.' I am much pleased with the paper, and may become a
subscriber at no distant day. I received copies of Mr. Wendte's
sermon, 'What do Unitarians Believe?' I have distributed them where
I thought they would do the most good, and have reason to think
that good was accomplished. Before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> long I will send to you for
more books; and if I can help you in obtaining subscribers to the
'Register' I will gladly do so. I am not a member of any church,
and stand almost alone in the church I attend [Methodist], in my
views. Our people seem to be almost entirely divided into three
classes; namely, the strictly Orthodox, the wholly indifferent or
non-thinking class, and the ultra Liberal. I am in sympathy with
neither; and I know of only a few, all young boys like myself, who
occupy middle ground. I can almost <i>fully</i> indorse the views
expressed by Rev. C. W. Wendte in the sermon to which I have
referred; and believing his views to be right, I take pleasure in
giving them as wide a circulation as I can. In many respects I
admire Ingersoll; but I have no sympathy with the so-called
'Liberal League' with which he is connected, and which has an
auxiliary league in this county.</p>

<p>"... If I understand the theory and purpose of your church, I shall
be glad to render the cause any service in my power; and if I can
be of any service as an auxiliary to your Missionary Society, I
have only to be instructed in the ways thereof."</p></blockquote>

<p>As such auxiliary he acted, distributing tracts, papers, etc., with a
zeal that might well shame some life-long Unitarians. In later letters
he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Outside of all churches there is quite a number of men, mostly
young, intelligent men, who have cultivated an intense hatred of
certain doctrines and religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> observances, and who have
gradually come to denounce and seek the overthrow of our whole
religious system. These are banded together as an auxiliary to the
'Liberal League' of America. In addition to these are a number of
young men, sons of Orthodox parents, who dissent from the religious
views and peculiar creeds which have satisfied their elders, and
yet have no definite faith of their own. I think that with these
two classes, as well as with those who have so far been indifferent
to the claim of religion, we have an excellent prospect of success
in introducing our views and extending the influence of Liberal
Christianity. I am very friendly to the Orthodox Church,
recognizing the noble purpose that animates them all, and the
invaluable services that they have rendered to mankind; and I have
less desire to draw upon their strength than I have to see the
Unitarian Church built up from material that has formerly been
identified with <i>no</i> church organization. I was a Unitarian in
theory long before I knew anything of the Unitarian Church.... As a
rule, the young men of my acquaintance who are, either in theory or
practice, liberal Christians, are of the most intelligent order,
ambitious, progressive young men; and of <i>them</i> what may we not
hope?"</p></blockquote>

<p>He went into business in Leadville, Colorado, and from there wrote Miss
Ellis (in 1881):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Sunday is almost entirely ignored in the business portion of the
city, very few men closing their places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> of business. Every saloon
and theatre is open on Sunday, and brass bands fill the air with
their inspiring music. I attended the Methodist Episcopal Church
Sabbath School last Sunday, and found quite a respectable crowd in
attendance. I thoroughly enjoyed that afternoon; and when I saw
rough-bearded, grimy, slouchy-looking men and boys from the mines
and workshops taking part in the exercises of the school, I thanked
God for the influence his church and school had had upon the
largest, hardest mining-camp in the world.... If you have any more
of the documents referred to, I wish you would send me a dozen or
more, and a few of the pamphlets on 'What Do Unitarians Believe?'
It seems to me this would be a most fruitful field in which to
plant Unitarian ideas and principles. It seems to me no other
church would be so popular here. Of the party of ten young men who
board with me, I do not think that any one of them has been in a
church three times since he came to Leadville. In most respects,
all of them are fine young men; but Orthodox doctrines would never
gain any ground with them, while Liberal ideas might win the field
if the boys could be made to consider them."</p></blockquote>

<p>Miss Ellis, and all the ladies, indeed, of the Cincinnati Auxiliary,
were greatly interested in Leadville, and hoped to do a good work there,
aided by our enthusiastic young friend; but the above was destined to be
our last letter from him. In September, 1881, came a postal card from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
hotel clerk, saying, "Mr. Woodruff wishes me to inform you that he has
been unable to answer your letter on account of sickness, but will write
you as soon as able." A few days later came intelligence of his death.
Tributes to his character in the Ravenna newspapers, and his photograph
sent Miss Ellis by his sister, only confirmed our opinion of this young
man's noble character, and our sincere grief at his loss. Miss Ellis at
once wrote to his mother this letter:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="right"><span class="smcap">October 17, 1881.</span></p>

<p>I shall be compelled to address the envelope containing this note
to your daughter, not knowing your husband's name. I presume you
are aware that Miss &mdash;&mdash; informed me of your son's death, and she,
I presume, sent me so kindly the paper last week containing the
obituary on him which I read with much interest, as it was such an
opinion as I and all of us had formed of your son, Julius, from his
interesting letters. I assure you that our love and sympathy are
with you in the affliction, and would that we could soften the
severe loss to you; but that alone the good Father in time can
render less bitter. True resignation consists in enduring it as
God's will.</p>

<p>The ladies of our Missionary Society wish me to tell you how much
all were interested in Julius's letters, and how deeply they feel
with you, and at my request send you a book of consolation, "Light
on the Cloud,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> as an expression of our real interest in your son.
It seemed to me that nothing could be so appropriate as the
literature he so learned to love. "He being dead yet speaketh"
(Heb. xi. 4); and such we deem would be his words to those who were
so dear to him. The President of our society marked one piece,&mdash;"He
giveth his beloved sleep," and I have marked passages through the
book, particularly under the head "Death a Blessing," and the last
poem in the book. If words can cheer you, it is our hope that this
little gift may serve the purpose. At least may it be a testimonial
to you of our deep interest in your dear boy.... Our ladies are to
hold the first meeting this season a week from to-morrow, when the
obituary notice of Julius R. Woodruff's death will be read, and
listened to with interest. He was my first correspondent, and his
letter from Colorado was particularly enjoyable. It grieves me to
think it was the last.... Hoping to hear farther from you, dear
friend, through your daughter or Miss&mdash;&mdash;, and to have the pleasure
of becoming personally acquainted with you at some future day, with
a God's blessing on you one and all, far and near,</p>

<p class="right">Yours in common sorrow,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">S. Ellis</span>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The correspondence was continued with Mr. Woodruff's sister as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">November 11, 1881.</span></p>

<p>... Yes, you may call me your "friend," for I truly feel that I
have lost a dear and true friend in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> your brother, and consequently
feel interested in all of his family, and do not wonder that your
mother and the whole family are heart-broken to be called to give
him up. Am sincerely glad that you felt free to express all your
feelings to me, for now I can sympathize more deeply with you. You
are just the age I was when my first sorrow came upon me,&mdash;the
death of my dear mother. As you say, I felt that I must keep up, to
cheer my father, who has ever been a domestic man, and the loss of
my mother was very hard for him to bear, and the five little
children to be cared for, I the oldest daughter at home, and had
been my mother's "right-hand man" in the care of the children. But
all our sorrows and trials are good for us to bear, and we need the
crosses as well as the joys of life to fit us for the life here and
for that which is to come.</p>

<p>It was hard to be reconciled to the death of one so young and so
good and true as Julius; but we must not be selfish, but think what
is our loss is the gain of those taken, many times. He may, through
his spiritual influence, still care for and lead you all nearer to
God. These "dark hours of life" bring us to know ourselves better;
they call out our sympathy for our fellow-men; and, what is more
than all, they bring us nearer to God, and thus they are not a mere
cross of agony; therefore let us not murmur at our affliction, but
still believe that God is good, and will so make our trials serve
us that they may become <i>good</i> to us.... We must trust God, who
doeth all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> things for the best, and pray for strength and light to
be given us. Our prayers may not always be answered as we ask, but
they are answered in another way.</p>

<p>The whole of Whittier's "Angels of Grief" and a poem by Ellerton are
copied in addition.</p>

<p>The correspondence was continued, occasionally, during Miss Ellis's
life. Aug. 11, 1882, she wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Young women, Miss&mdash;&mdash;, have great influence over young men, and I
hope you struggle to improve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> all those whom you know. Have you
ever come across Frances Power Cobbe's 'Duties of Women'? It is a
remarkably sensible book, and I feel as if every young girl ought
to read it. I think you would do your young friends a service by
owning it and passing it around among them. You can get it in paper
for twenty-five cents. It is not a doctrinal work at all. She
delivered the lectures in London, to women. Neither is it a Woman's
Rights book altogether, but what any girl or young man, come to
that, ought to do and practise. Are you going to resume school
after vacation again, or what do you intend to turn your attention
to?</p>

<p>"I have not been very strong since I was sick last August,
therefore have not done much this year. I go into the city every
two weeks on Saturday <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, to be at the church to loan books to
any one who desires them. Was there last Saturday, and two strange
ladies came in who proved very pleasant; one a young girl. She came
after 'Helps to Devout Living,' for a sister who has gone out to
Nebraska for her health, and is miles away from any church and has
no companionable people about her. This young sister also selected
for herself 'Day unto Day,' as a book of daily study in an upward
path. It is such pleasant work to have it within my power to loan
and to recommend so many good books to those who have not read
them. They always enjoy them. Julius would have been so happy in it
out at Leadville."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Woodruff's sister wrote, Feb. 15, 1886:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>"Some one very kindly sent us the obituary of our dear friend Miss
Ellis. We were surprised and deeply grieved to hear of her death,
as we did not know that her health was poor even. She said so
little about herself, that we never thought of her as otherwise
than well and strong.... I enjoyed Miss Ellis's letters so much,
and we appreciated her kindness in writing to us after my dear
brother's death. He thought so much of Miss Ellis, and I know if he
had lived you would not have been disappointed in him. I cannot
thank you sufficiently for the little book you sent mother after
J&mdash;&mdash;'s death. Truly it was a 'Light on the Cloud,' and it
comforted mother more than I can tell you. It is so full of
comforting words.</p>

<p>"Though Miss Ellis is gone from us, she has left behind the
influence of a life so pure, so noble, and so grand, that we will
all be the better for having known her. As my brother once wrote in
a friend's album, 'God wisely wills that we may not know the number
of our years, and in view of the uncertainty which enshrouds each
to-morrow, let us so live that be our lives long or short, the
little home-world that surrounds us will be the better for our
having lived in it.' Can we not say that these two did not live in
vain? My brother had a great influence over young people and also
over some who were much older than he, and had he been spared, I
feel sure that he would have done a grand work for the cause of
Christianity. But their life work is ended only too soon; and why
they should be taken when they were doing so much good, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> others
who are a burden to themselves and others are left, I suppose we
shall know sometime; and until that time we must believe that 'He
doeth all things well.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Miss Ellis's letters frequently express her joy in a young man who had
become a Unitarian minister through her efforts. He was a Methodist
minister in Ohio, but had grown unable longer to accept the creed of his
church. Unhappy, unsettled, and adrift, not knowing where to turn for
help, by the merest "chance" he picked up on a railroad car a Cincinnati
paper, and his eye fell on the Women's Auxiliary Conference
advertisement. He wrote Miss Ellis a postal card, saying:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I have seen your notice in the 'Commercial,' offering Unitarian
papers and tracts free to persons who may desire to read them. I
must confess to more ignorance in regard to Unitarian doctrines
than is seemly in a minister of the gospel, and will be thankful
indeed if you will kindly favor me with such papers and tracts as
may enlighten me ever so little."</p></blockquote>

<p>Later he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"You have helped me not a little in my search for truth. Before I
first wrote you for tracts, etc., I knew absolutely nothing of
Unitarianism beyond the term, and the fact that Unitarians did not
believe Christ to have been God."</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Ellis corresponded with him from that time on, loaning many books,
etc. It was never her wish or aim to unsettle persons of a fixed faith.
She sought rather to reach and help those who, by reading and thinking,
had become dissatisfied with the only forms of religious faith known to
them, and were consequently drifting into scepticism. Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s own
letters best tell the story. After Miss Ellis's death, he wrote Feb.
3,1886:</p>

<blockquote><p>"I had long been wondering why I did not hear from her, but
supposed that she found her time so engrossed with her chosen work
that she must defer writing until some more convenient season. She
had, it is true, hinted at her failing health, but I never dreamed
it was so bad. My first intimation of the real state of affairs was
the notice of her death. I need not say that I was startled, that I
regret our common loss; these are but feeble expressions.</p>

<p>"Through all my life here at Cambridge I have been anticipating the
day when, returning West, I should meet her, and in some degree
thank her for the help and comfort she brought me in life. This has
become such a fixed idea with me, that it is hard to believe, as I
write this, that it can never be in this world. It seems very
strange that the one friend who did me such a supreme kindness in
life I shall never meet.</p>

<p>"She was the very messenger of God to me, and is inseparably
associated with the most trying period of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> my life. The only
conceptions of religion I had ever had were proving unreal and
worthless, and no one offered anything as a substitute. As I look
back, the peril of my situation seems much greater than it did at
the time. I fear I should have become insincere, or, what is
perhaps almost as bad, should have fallen into a sort of despairing
scepticism. Heaven in mercy saved me from it; but I shall not
forget that even Heaven might not have found a way to do this, had
there been no Miss Ellis. It was but a little thing, a trifle, a
brief notice in a daily paper, that in some way caught a careless
reader's eye. But my whole life is changed in consequence.</p>

<p>"And so, while you miss her in her place and in your work, in your
church and social life, I, too, here in New England miss her. I
feel as if something is gone out of my life and I have really one
less reason for returning West when my school work is done. But I
have if possible an additional incentive to a good life. I trust I
shall hear that your work is still going on successfully. I assure
you I shall never lose interest in your Mission, and shall never
cease to regard it as in some sense a home into which I was
adopted. I sincerely hope I shall never do it any discredit."</p></blockquote>

<p>In a letter to Mrs. Hunert, Miss Ellis's successor, he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Accept, please, my hearty congratulations, and my best wishes for
your very abundant success. It is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> great work indeed, one that
cannot be easily over-estimated, and in which it seems to me you
can accomplish a minister's work even, and a very successful
minister's work at that. I wonder how large your congregation is
now; that is, how many persons are in communication with you and
your Mission.</p>

<p>"Of Miss Ellis I shall always think as one of my greatest earthly
benefactors, and it will be a life-long regret that I never met
her.... I wish you would say to Mrs. Smith that I have by me here
in New England only the letters received from Miss Ellis since
coming to Harvard, and these I fear contain nothing she would like
to make use of. The really helpful letters, those that were of most
vital interest to me, were written while I was a Methodist preacher
in Ohio, and these are back there still, packed up among odds and
ends, and practically might almost as well be in the moon.... Again
accept my best wishes for your success in the new calling,&mdash;a
divine one in the truest sense of the word. I assure you I shall
always be glad to hear of the growth and success of your Mission,
all the more, perhaps, because I hold to it a sort of filial
relation. You know that in the Methodist Church each young convert
or young minister speaks of the minister under whose preaching he
was converted, as a spiritual father. So I think of myself now as
the spiritual child of your Women's Missionary Society in
Cincinnati. Would that Heaven might help me to be worthy of the
home, and justify in some sense their loving-kindness and help in
time of need."</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>A gentleman in Kentucky, long a correspondent of Miss Ellis, who had
taken papers, bought many books, etc., through her, and who has recently
died, wrote of her, Jan. 22, 1886:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Many souls will miss the modest, unassuming, faithful secretary,
but her silent labors will be followed by a rich reward. Her
memorial is in the hearts and minds of those who were led through
her efforts to freedom, fellowship, and character, in religion."</p></blockquote>

<p>This correspondent was a farmer's wife in Ohio, who, after Miss Ellis's
death, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I have had much trouble in the last two years, and would have
given up to utter despair many times, if it had not been for her
kind letters and sermons. I made a confidential friend of her; so,
knowing my situation, she knew what sermons would serve most to
strengthen me, and sometimes she would come across sermons in
papers that she would cut out and send me. I have them yet, and
intend to paste them in a scrapbook. I thought of calling upon her
father to see if he had a picture that he would allow me to have a
copy from, so I am very glad her portrait will be in the book.... I
learned to <i>love</i> Miss Ellis, and shall <i>never</i> forget her."</p></blockquote>

<p>There was a little family of step-children living on a remote Ohio farm,
in whom Miss Ellis took a warm personal interest, advising as to their
religious training, sending them children's papers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> and books. "Miss
Ellis" came to be regarded as a dear friend by these children who never
saw her. March 16, 1885, she wrote to the mother:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Your letter was received a week since, but I have been sick three
weeks with a very severe cough and cold. Have been up and about,
but could not accomplish much of anything, and especially writing,
and still had much of it to do.... Wanted to advise you about the
Sunday-school lessons. Order the lessons of 'Home Life' from
Chicago at present, and then next, if you can, 'Corner-Stones of
Character;' but do not get the 'Old Testament Chart,' for I have
some very good lessons on the Old Testament that you will like and
can have immediately.... Am so sorry you have so much sadness to
contend against. However, you must feel that all your sacrifices
are known by the good Father in heaven; so to him turn in your hour
of need. There is a hymn Mr. Thayer often selects for our opening
on Sunday. We sang it last Sunday,&mdash;'Daily Consecration,' by
Caroline Mason.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Oh God! I thank thee for each sight<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of beauty that thy hand doth give;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For sunny skies, and air, and light,&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And ever, as the day is born,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">To thank thee for another morn:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>"Let your first thoughts be turned to God in the morning, and in
the day's struggles believe that you are in his presence; and even
if your earthly life is not such as you may wish, you may rest
assured that your tears are counted above.... My own life is much
brighter than it was. My brother &mdash;&mdash; has an only child, three and
a half years old, who is very cunning, and much company for us all.
On Friday I passed my semi-centennial birthday, which a number of
my friends kindly remembered.... I was not strong enough to enjoy
the occasion fully; but still on the whole it was a bright day to
me, and on Sunday I was glad Mr. Thayer selected the beautiful
hymn, 'Daily Consecration.' I am too weak to write longer.... May
God bless and strengthen you for your daily toils."</p></blockquote>

<p>On the envelopes of all these letters was written, "From my friend Miss
Ellis." To the oldest child, who was difficult to influence, Miss Ellis
addressed this letter:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">My dear M&mdash;&mdash;</span>: I wonder if you ever had any one write a letter to
you, and whether you can read a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> letter yourself. If not, your
mamma will read it to you. She has told me that you are having a
little Sunday-school of your own at home, and I feel quite
interested in it, and am going to have two of the lessons sent to
your mamma from Chicago, hoping you three children will feel
interested in them. One is a very simple thing to learn,&mdash;"Rules to
make Home Pleasant;" and I hope you will all try to learn them, and
try to keep them in your daily life.... If children do not learn to
keep such rules, they never can have happy homes, for they will
grow up into ill-natured, lazy men and women. The other lesson is
called "Corner-Stones of Character," because it gives us true ideas
of what all children should learn in order to grow up into good,
truthful men and women.... Now I know you are studying together
Brown's "Life of Jesus," and these lessons I am to send you will
help you to understand better what Jesus did to make himself, with
God's help, become so good a man. I know, too, that you, M&mdash;&mdash;,
have a copy of "Daily Praise and Prayer," which is a very good
book. It is pleasant to me as I read in mine to think that Mrs.
&mdash;&mdash; and M&mdash;&mdash; are reading their lesson to-day, and I wonder if
they are thinking how beautiful it is, and that "Miss Ellis" and
many others are reading and asking God for the same goodness
to-day. It is so pleasant,&mdash;do you not think so?&mdash;to feel that our
good Father in heaven and all good, kind people are thinking of us
each day. It helps <i>us</i> to be good, to know that others are trying
in the same way,&mdash;do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> you not think so? You are the oldest of the
three children, and I want to hear from you, that by studying our
Sunday-school lessons, and reading in sensible books, and playing
with well-behaved children, you are all becoming wiser and better,
and helping mamma and each other. I will also send you some verses
all the children in our Sunday-school learned one winter.... There
are many things I could talk to you about, but I must leave the
rest till another day. It will be sufficient for you to know that
some one on earth feels interested in your life at home, with a
kind mother to lead you so well.... I will say good-by now, and
hope you will learn to write to me. With love to all of you, very
kindly your friend.</p></blockquote>

<p>Miss Ellis corresponded frequently with a young man in Canada (living in
a city where, so far as known, he is the only Unitarian), beginning in
1882, and loaning him many books. He, too, was in a state of religious
doubt and despair, when chance threw the little advertisement in his
way. He intends to enter the Unitarian ministry, as is shown by the
following extracts from the correspondence. Miss Ellis wrote him Oct.
21, 1882:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Monday afternoon I mailed "Religion in Evolution" to you, and I
have imagined you eagerly poring over the book this week in high
ecstasies.... To me James F. Clarke's views and Dr. Furness's seem
more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> just and reliable. But Dr. Clarke says, "What commends itself
best to our reason, must be the truth;" therefore Mr. Savage may
benefit you more. If he rouses you to a deep faith and makes you
truly Christian, that is the point to be gained. Should like to
have you compare James F. Clarke with Mr. Savage, on the Humanity
of Jesus and the Miracles and the Resurrection, particularly.
"Bible for Learners," Vol. III., takes the same view, about, of the
Miracles and Resurrection,&mdash;"myths and legends," "not an external
fact of history, but simply a form of belief assumed by the faith
of his friends and earliest disciples." James F. Clarke, in "Truths
and Errors of Orthodoxy," in the chapter Miracles, says, "The
resurrection may have been an example of a universal law." Dr.
Furness says: "Till men know all the laws of God it is rather
presumptuous in them to set the resurrection aside as an
impossibility." These are not his exact words; but the purport I
have quoted from memory. To return to Dr. Clarke.... [Then follows
a long extract from Clarke, which is omitted here.] Dr. Clarke's
view is the most likely and rational to me; but all the more
radical men take the view of the German critics, and look upon it
rather as "myths and legends" arising from a simple faith of the
disciples. The only way is to read for yourself and compare,
forming an opinion of your own, while remembering that Christianity
does not rest on a certain belief, but on the life. "What doth the
Lord thy God require of thee, but to do justly, love mercy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> and
walk humbly with thy God," are the words of the prophet Micah.
James F. Clarke believes firmly in the simple, pure humanity of
Jesus, best shown in "Steps of Belief," under the "Historical
Christ." I have "Steps of Belief," "Truths and Errors of
Orthodoxy," also "Bible for Learners" and "Talks about Jesus" (M.
J. Savage), to loan you. You have only to say which you wish
first.... I am tired, and must rise early to be in the city in time
for Sunday-school, so I will tear off the paper here, or I shall go
on writing all night. Have more good sermons to send you. Wish you
could go to Boston, join the Young Men's Christian Union
(Unitarian), and be helped into what God means you and all to be,
by putting our faculties to the highest use we are capable of.
Hoping to hear further from you,</p>

<p class="right">Truly your friend,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Sarah Ellis</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sunday Evening.</i> Our sermon to-day was on the "Effects of Modern
Scientific Thought upon the Essentials of Religion." If it is
published, will send you a copy of it.... I think the hymn will
meet your views, therefore copy it. Do you know it?</p></blockquote>

<p>The hymn referred to is the one, "God Ever Near," by T. H. Gill,
beginning:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What secret place, what distant star,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O Lord of all, is thine abode?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Miss Ellis copies it in full. In 1883 the young man wrote Miss Ellis:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"A year ago I was in the dreariest stage of agnosticism. I was in
despair at times, and sometimes my very soul seemed to be in agony.
Through reading scientific literature I had been convinced that
most of the religious teaching I had learned was false. The
flippancy and shallowness of Ingersoll and his school disgusted me.
I could not find rest in materialism; I considered it as far astray
from the truth as Orthodoxy. I was nineteen years old, and found
myself facing the most tremendous problems of existence. I tried to
tell myself to wait for maturer years to solve them, and to a great
extent that satisfied me. But I still yearned for
<i>something</i>,&mdash;simply this: 'My soul cried out for the living God!'
Alas! I could not find him. I looked around me for a little
sympathy or a kind word even, but I looked in vain. Every Sunday I
heard denunciations of such views as mine. I heard a great deal of
'blatant atheists,' 'infidel scientists,' etc., but no sympathy for
a despairing agnostic,&mdash;only scorn and ridicule. It pained me
intensely to be misunderstood by even those dearest to me on earth,
but I determined to stand firm for what I took to be the truth. Oh
for some men to preach a little charity for the views of others,
and to consider a man as not being necessarily worse than a
criminal because he cannot accept their own views! I owe you a
large debt of gratitude for being the means of lifting me out of a
state of misery and despair, in which I had no pleasure in life,
into a state of cheerfulness, happiness, hope, and peace; not
intellectual peace,&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> I do not expect that,&mdash;but real 'soul
peace,' a calm trust and a real faith in a living God. I have been
surprised to see how largely Unitarian theology is based on
science. I owe it to science that my life is something more than
daily drudgery. The foundation of my scepticism was laid when I
learned the rudiments of natural philosophy in school. I was
astonished at what I read of Nature's wonders. Since leaving school
I have been an ardent reader of all kinds of scientific literature.
By means of the Mechanics' Institute I have the use of all the
magazines, reviews, etc., besides a splendid library. I have read a
great deal that I did not understand,&mdash;books which are beyond my
years; but I have a good idea of what is occupying the minds of the
world's thinkers in this nineteenth century. One of the best
lessons I have learned from the literature you have sent me is
faith,&mdash;a very different kind of faith from the mere credulity I
once knew by that name. At times I am dazed and confounded when I
think of the great mysteries surrounding us, especially of the
mysteries of death; but I feel that a good God is over all, and the
main thing is to do right, and all will be well. I cannot express
how much I owe you for the great good you have done me. You have my
heartfelt thanks."</p></blockquote>

<p>In another letter he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"To say that I am delighted with 'The Religion of Evolution' is but
a poor way of expressing myself. You could not have sent me a more
timely book. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> would like to get all of Mr. Savage's books. You
'wish I could go to Boston,' etc. Ah! you do not know how I
sometimes yearn for some such thing myself. I find my great
pleasure and recreation in intellectual pursuits; and of course I
have not nearly so great advantages in a small city as I would have
in a large one. But for meditation and communion with the Infinite,
communion with Nature and the incomprehensible God, I must have
solitude. It was a favorite dream of my childhood that I would be a
minister. But I have to work in another way. My father died when I
was six years of age, and my mother therefore had a struggle to
give us an education,&mdash;that inestimable blessing of a common-school
education. I feel that the highest work for me is to support her to
the best of my ability.... I value highly the sermons you send me.
Most of our churches here offer one 'dry bones' instead of the
living truth. Do you know of any low-priced publication which would
give me a fair sketch of Theodore Parker's life and thought? I
would like to know something of him. I am greatly pleased with the
'Register.' Mr. Savage's sermons are also a feast to me. The
sermons of J. F. Clarke you sent me in June have a ring about them
and a spirit in them that I find in few others."</p></blockquote>

in "Day unto Day," particularly "Jan. 9&mdash;Parsons." You are quite
young, remember, and there are many years for you to improve in,
"and room for improvement," as people always say.... I will not
allow <i>your</i> want of time to keep me from writing you. It is my own
lack of time, and troublesome eyes. Have been very busy this
winter. Have a gentleman in Alabama who is becoming much interested
in Unitarian theology, and also one in Kentucky. It keeps my mind
at work to send just the right thing to each one. My eyes are
troubling me much this evening. Must close, to make some last
preparations for Sunday, as I have to start early in the morning to
be in time, and must also write a postal to a young nephew in
Philadelphia, who is very fond of me and remembered me Christmas

<p>I must answer your question, "Why no denunciation of sin (by
Unitarians)?" In the New Hampshire "Statement of Belief" I first
sent you, if you still have it, you will find: "(4) In Human
Nature, as not ruined, but incomplete. Man is not fallen from a
primitive state of holiness, but is imperfectly developed. Being
imperfect, he is liable to sin.... <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span><i>The essence of sin is the
failure of the higher nature of man to rule his lower nature.</i>
Human nature is made sacred by the indwelling presence of God.
Humanity is not tending downward, but is divinely guided from lower
to higher forms of moral and spiritual life."</p>

<p>Starting from such a high ideal of man's nature,&mdash;that he is
created in the "image of God," and as found in the first chapter of
Genesis, I think, and in Psalms viii.: "Thou hast made him a little
lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with honor and
glory,"&mdash;we feel him capable of so much, that our ministers are too
busy talking concerning <i>being</i> and <i>doing</i> good to have any time
left for denunciation of sin. Our great concern is to raise man in
<i>every</i> way. Teach him to be cheerful, looking <i>forward</i> all the
time, moving onward and upward, and to find no opportunity to spend
in vain regrets,&mdash;only looking at his sins long enough to learn
lessons from the past, that he may avoid them in the future. Our
sins leave a deep stain that will affect us during our lifetime,
but the only way to overcome them is to be so engaged in right
doing that we rise above them. Now, do you not think this a far
higher way of converting men than by dwelling on their weaknesses?
Give the world something higher to do all the time, and they will
naturally rise to that level. We start from a higher standpoint
than the Orthodox, therefore our methods are very different. We
denounce sin by avoiding it whenever we come in contact with it, or
evil of any kind, and there is no more effectual way of overcoming
it. Do you not see why it is we have ceased to speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> of it in
sermons? We are too busy with the good, the true, the beautiful, to
pay attention to the wickedness. Dr. Dewey wrote some stirring
sermons, on "Human Nature." The topic of one is, "On the Wrong
which Sin does to Human Nature;"&mdash;text from Prov. viii. 36: "He
that sinneth against me, wrongeth his own soul." That was the
former way of dealing with and denouncing sin; but the later way
is, to take care always to place the better in people's way, and
the sins will fall behind. Think you not so?</p></blockquote>

<p>... We sometimes strain at <i>words</i> when in reality we agree with
others. If we would only remember to strive to discover wherein we
agree, and not always be looking for divergence of opinion, there
would be more of practical piety in the world. Let us open our eyes
to the fact that <i>all</i> denominations endeavor to make men better,
though they differ in methods; and see to it that we ourselves are
true to the highest and best as far as we know it, and the kingdom
of God will be hastened in everywhere. Do right for its own sake,
and not from fear or hope of punishment or reward. Let me give you
a hymn we sang after the sermon last Sunday. The subject was, "This
life: why we are in it, and what we have a right to expect of it."
The hymn is one of Rev. Samuel Longfellow's, "Life's Mission:"&mdash;</p>

<p>He had consulted her about the propriety of his contributing to the
support of the Methodist church when he no longer accepted its
doctrines. She wrote in reply, Oct. 6, 1884:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>... "There are two precepts which come to my mind when I am
perplexed as to what to do, which I will mention: 'What doth the
Lord require of thee, but to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk
humbly with thy God?' (Micah vi. 8). The other: 'If ye have not the
spirit of Christ, ye are none of his,'&mdash; from the epistles, but
can't recall it just now. If you conclude to contribute to the
Methodist church, you could tell Mr. B&mdash;&mdash; what your intention had
been, and how I reasoned upon the subject. However, act just as you
come to the conclusion. The thing is to do as you believe to be
just. I should think the church I attended had the first claim upon
me. 'Duty before pleasure' is true in any church. Am glad you think
so well of Unitarianism, and hope you may be able to work heartily
with us some day. Only be patient."</p></blockquote>

will be a position full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> self-denial many times, but on the
other hand will bring its own rich rewards, known only to the true
minister of God. To encourage you in the many hours of
discouragement, I advise Dr. Furness's sermon on the "Solitude of
Christ," in "Register" of May 8,1884, I think, which I believe has
been sent you, but if not, will hunt it up and send it to you; and
besides that, the words of Jesus: "He that hath put his hand to the
plough and looketh back, is not worthy of me;" therefore have
firmly fixed in your mind the glorious hymn by Rev. Samuel Johnson,
"The Conflict of Life."</p></blockquote>

so utterly alone, though surrounded by dear, old, and tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
friends. This lack of one congenial person or thing no one can
appreciate but those who have experienced.... Remember, <i>opinions</i>
separate us, but kindly deeds and affection draw us close to one
another; and so pursue your studies patiently, striving to make
yourself the kind of man you think one ought to be, and in
attending church do it in the spirit of Jesus,&mdash;with the feeling of
worshipping God, and cast aside all other feeling, knowing that
those around you are doing what they feel to be best. Leave it to
the Good Father to judge them, and in time to help them to see
differently. We are judged by living up to the highest and best we
know, and if others have not been so far enlightened as we, or have
not been moved by the Spirit to seek higher light and truth, we
must work in patience and leave them in the hands of God.... Only
be true to your own convictions, and you will lead them by example
rather than precept, unconsciously to them. Work on patiently, and
God's promises will not fail you. It is a slow process to overcome
one's many failures; but we shall come out conquerors at the last
if we only will, and are earnest in our endeavors.... After two

the thought that the generality of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> Unitarian ministers are cut off
from all companionship with ministers of other denominations where
they are settled, and are seldom permitted to enter into charities,
where they are, with other ministers. It has been the case ever
since the days of Jesus, that those who really hold his views are
separated from others in the community. But as you say, and many
more say, "if we have God alone, that is enough." I cannot consider
myself a "theist" entirely, but might call myself a "Christian
theist." I have come to know God as manifested through Jesus, but
have as much respect for those who do as Jesus did, and who have as
firm a trust in the Father as Jesus had. Think that is what Jesus
taught, and labored to have no man worship him. "There is none good
but One," he said; "why callest thou me good?" Though I value
Jesus, I do not worship him, or feel that he is my support in life.
I only look to him in difficulties and trials to show me the way to
the Father. I ask to worship and to live in his spirit and so gain
strength from the Father wherewith to do. You and others look more
to men of later date, who have learned from others nearer to them;
but if we trace it all back to the beginning, we will find it is
Jesus' spirit working through them. So one and all, whoever they
are, wherever found, who have the spirit of Christ, are the sons of
God, whether they call themselves merely theists, or Christian
theists, it seems to me. George Eliot was truly religious, though
perhaps not a Christian in the common acceptation.</p></blockquote>

<p>I do not know as I "have ever realized the depths of absolute
negations," but I have realized the depths of absolute solitude,
and can sympathize with you in your loneliness, and "think it a
good thing to keep the Eternal and Infinite always in view, and so
love quiet, solitude, and meditation. They strengthen me to do my
work in life." Do not despair, then, if you are despondent at
times. Every one is, and it is good for us to some extent to be
disgusted with ourselves; it makes us know ourselves. "The dark
hours of life bring us nearer to our fellow-men, help us to know
ourselves and bring us nearer to God." God has put these
questionings into you for some wise purpose. Be true to your
highest and best self, and work them out by degrees. But remember
you are young yet, and there is time for you to solve all these
mysteries in. Do not try to solve all the great questions of life
at once. Be patient, and do not brood too much. Meditation and
solitude are good, but try to mingle somewhat with those around
you. See God in the world about you, as well as in the stars. I

<p>He wrote Miss Ellis, Aug. 24, 1885:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"A shadow has come across my way of late,&mdash;a great disappointment.
I think I mentioned it to you before. A doctor, an acquaintance of
mine, has often told me that I studied and read too much.... It is
hard for me to realize this, but he insists on a year's rest from
study. This will postpone my entrance to Meadville for two years, I
fear. I confess to great disappointment over this. I will be past
twenty-five when I get to Meadville; and yet there is another side.
I have often questioned my fitness for this great work. I wish to
be cautious. I do believe that I have a noble gospel to preach. 'To
preach,'&mdash;but first to live it. And, in shame I confess it, I have
not lived it. It will therefore be a good thing if in these two
years I give myself to growth in manhood. But enough of this. These
matters must be dealt with in the closet,&mdash;the soul's closet....
After my taste of Montreal fellowship I am sick with loneliness
here. It is fearful, at times, this longing for one friend even,
and finding none. But it must be borne without grumbling. And now I
must stop. The doctor would object to even this light piece of
writing. Thank you kindly for sending me the 'Register' and
'Unity.' It is very good of you to look after me so much. Be
assured that your kindness is giving great encouragement to a
lonely one who, amid much opposition and misunderstanding from his
dearest ones, is making at least a <i>little</i> honest effort to be
true to himself and God. I would that I were fully faithful; but it
is not so. Still I think your seed will yet bear fruit, and spring
up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> a life devoted to the uplifting of mankind. My deepest
prayer is for this. I trust your health will improve. Still more do
I trust that you may continue to grow nearer God, and help others
to do so, as you have helped me."</p></blockquote>

<p>Miss Ellis replied, Aug. 30, 1885:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"... I have neglected you of late, thinking you were soon to go to
Meadville, and that you were busy. We are sorry to hear of your
great disappointment. It is a disappointment to us as well,
particularly to me. However, we need the reverses and crosses of
life as much as the air we breathe, to strengthen our characters.
You have pushed yourself so hard with business and studies the past
two years, that you have not taken time to view the life around you
in the right light. Let the next two years be given principally to
building up your character individually and socially, and to
improving your health, as one of the first requisites of a minister
is a sound mind and a healthy body. Be social; take life
cheerfully; make those about you better for your company; and
mingle freely with your family and best friends, showing them you
are practising Unitarianism. Yes; make these two coming years tell
as a preparation for college in another way, and let them prove a
blessing to you, though a disappointment at first. Did you read
Rev. E. E. Hale's 'Methods,' in 'Register' a few weeks since? This
week's 'Register' contains an excellent sermon by Rev. John
Clifford on 'Spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> Building.' Have a home worship of your own
sometimes. During the vacation, every Sunday I have had a regular
worship. For instance, to-day I read for sermon, 'Spiritual
Building;' opening hymn, 'Come, Thou Almighty, help us to praise;'
'Scriptures Old and New' (a compilation by Mr. Forbush and Mr.
Hosmer, from all religions, and an excellent thing to have), Lesson
27,&mdash;'The Kingdom within us;' prayer, followed by Scripture lesson,
Galatians iii., from which is taken text; then Wesley's hymn, 'The
whole armor of God;' sermon; closing hymn, Doddridge's 'Awake, my
soul, stretch every nerve,' etc. Have been interested during the
vacation in looking over Gannett's 'Childhood of Jesus' and
Carpenter's 'Palestine when Jesus lived.' Also bought 'Selections
from the Apocrypha,' compiled by Mrs. Tileston, who compiled 'Daily
Strength.' Readings from the Apocrypha are so common in Unitarian
pulpits now, that it is well to be familiar with the best portions.
Am not able to do much reading now. Am physically too weak. Never
was able to use my brain to its full extent,&mdash;feeble and nervous
all my life, but active otherwise."</p></blockquote>

<p>Miss Ellis's last letter to him was written but little more than a month
before her death, when in the utmost weakness herself; but to this she
makes no allusion. It was a letter of consolation in bereavement, from
which this is an extract:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">November</span> 18, 1885.</p>

<p>... The only way to reconcile ourselves to our sorrows is to think
of those who are worse off than ourselves. It makes us less
inclined to murmur in our own sadness. It is good for us to bear
the cross. If things were always as we would have them, many
virtues would never be developed. There are so many comforting
pieces in "Sunshine in the Soul." Some I marked for a former
correspondent. Mr. Thayer read for his Scripture lesson last
Sunday, Job. iv. 5; and v. 6-11; 17 to end. I have no doubt your
sister knows many comforting passages; but the real comfort is
found in keeping ourselves busy for others, while at the same time
we lean and trust in God to give us peace of soul. We find it in
time as we go on patiently doing the duty just before us, and
loving the blessings which remain to us.</p></blockquote>

<p>One of Miss Ellis's last thoughts was for this correspondent. When
hardly able to speak, she requested a special "Register" sent to him. It
was sent, and a postal card informing him of her condition. He
replied:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="right"><span class="smcap">December</span> 25, 1885.</p>

<p>Your card came to me this morning. I am shocked at its sad message.
I was not in the least prepared for it. It seems to hold out no
hope. Though I have never seen Miss Ellis, she has been to me for
over three years a close friend. And now I must lose her
friendship, and her kind encouraging letters! But I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> am not
intending to complain of loss, but rather to be thankful for the
help I have received from her. I shall now have another motive to
work on, to be more faithful in life. That motive shall be the
memory of Miss Ellis's self-sacrificing life. I have a large
package of her letters which will be more valued now than ever
before. I do trust her work will go on; it ought to certainly. If I
can help I will gladly do so.</p></blockquote>

<p>Later, he wrote in reply to a letter announcing her death:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="right"><span class="smcap">January</span> 1, 1886.</p>

<p>I was very glad to hear a little of our dear friend who spends this
happy New Year's Day freed from all ills of the body. I can hardly
realize that she is gone. She never gave me a hint that she was
seriously ill, but always spoke cheerfully. It is such a short time
ago that I wrote to her as usual, not having the remotest thought
that she would never answer my letter. Her last letters to me are
dated Nov. 6 and 18, and, singularly enough, are almost entirely
taken up with remarks upon death and affliction. Not a word of
herself, however....</p>

<p>Miss Ellis wrote me two letters full of kindness and sympathy, and
sending cheering words to my sister; for she wrote, "Though I don't
know her, I feel deeply for her." It really is hardly possible to
estimate the influence, both direct and indirect, which Miss Ellis
has had upon my life. It is a very long story, this of my inquiries
in religious matters. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> always looked forward to the day when
I should see our friend and speak to her of it, and make some
expression of my gratitude to her. But it is not to be,&mdash;not in
this life, at least. Hereafter her letters shall be a source of
constant encouragement to me. I have them all, and glad I am of it,
for through them she will yet speak to me. I often wished to have a
photograph of her, and I am very sorry now that I too long
hesitated to take the first step in making a mutual exchange. Often
when weary through the day's work I have been cheered by her kind
letters. But this is only one limited instance of her influence.
For years I went to my daily work sad and heavy of heart because
life was aimless, almost dead. By the printed page Miss Ellis
showed me God,&mdash;God living, working, right here now, daily
surrounding me and all men. And lo! life has an aim, is full of
beauty and goodness and joy.... All this I owe to her.</p></blockquote>

<p>In response to a request for letters, he wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p class="right"><span class="smcap">February</span> 14, 1886.</p>

<p>In your card you speak of a book. I hope the pamphlet will grow
into a book. I was delighted to hear that it will contain a
portrait, for that will be just what I wish for. The letters I
sent, I had to just pick out hurriedly, as I had very little time.
If I had had more time, I might have made a better selection. I
will vouch for their quality, however. I have post cards
innumerable from her. Then again, once, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> I was having a sore
mental struggle over the philosophy of prayer, in answer to my
inquiries Miss Ellis wrote out for me the greater part of Mr.
Chadwick's sermon on "Prayer," in his "Faith of Reason." This I
mention as one out of many instances of such work. She never tired
of trying to aid me. I sent you the last letter I received from
her, never having a thought, at the time I received it, of its
being the <i>last</i> one. Perhaps Miss Ellis is aware of all this
afterglow, as you so well call it. I hope so. I believe so. How it
must gratify her to know what she accomplished!</p>

<p>In looking over these letters I am very forcibly reminded of the
last few years.... As you may suppose, Miss Ellis is much in my
thoughts. I looked forward to meeting her some day, and making
grateful acknowledgment of her influence for good on me. I would
not hide from you that I often regret that it is not to be so. But
every other thought is swallowed up in gratitude for her life and
for our meeting together.</p></blockquote>

<p>The following is Miss Ellis's first letter from a farmer's wife a dozen
miles out of Cincinnati, who has this winter become a member of the
Women's Auxiliary Conference, and wishes, with her daughter, to join the
church:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I have frequently seen the item in the Sunday's paper offering
Unitarian reading to those who wish it, and have as often
determined to avail myself of the opportunity, but have so far
neglected it. I will say that I have been for a long time somewhat
of a Unitarian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> without being sufficiently informed in the belief
openly to declare myself one. I would ask you to teach me from the
beginning the doctrines, so that I can understand and feel a safety
in embracing them. I have a daughter who will avail herself with me
of your kind offer. You are to be our teacher in the matter of
selecting the reading, and I will gladly pay postage on all books
sent."</p></blockquote>

<p>As such teacher Miss Ellis acted ever after. She wrote in reply, Jan. 1,
1884:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Was very glad to receive your letter to-day, and hope I may prove a
successful "teacher." Have always been a Unitarian, as my father
was among the first subscribers to the church, when it was
established in 1830.... Have sent you by this same mail three
tracts pertaining to our doctrines. Shall be glad to give you and
your daughter a weekly Sunday-school lesson for several weeks.
Began with statements of doctrine and Channing's famous Discourse.
On the list sent have numbered other tracts in the order in which I
shall send them,&mdash;leading you from Channing to Brigham and J. F.
Clarke, showing an advance in thought up to Mr. Wendte's tract,
"What Do Unitarians Believe?" which represents Unitarianism as held
by the <i>young</i> men of the present time; and after you read these
tracts, if you wish more doctrine, will mention some books we can
loan you by mail. With the tracts will also send the "Christian
Register," where you will see our principles carried out. It is a
very interesting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> able paper. Perhaps after you have examined a
few copies you may like to become a subscriber to it. I usually
spend Mondays mailing papers to our correspondents, though they do
not all get off till about Wednesday. They will be in time for a
Sunday lesson, however, and I hope you may find some neighbors to
join you in your study. Hoping this is a beginning of another good
work for us, and to hear from you further,</p>

many of the doctrines of the early times were invented by the men
of the day to suit some purpose of their own. Will shortly send you
a lesson paper by Rev. William C. Gannett, of St. Paul, Minn., on
"The Christmas Story and the Christmas Fact." These stories or
"legends" concerning Jesus were written some time after his death.
"Bible for Learners" says&mdash;[Here is copied a long extract.] I have
said enough to let you know that we do not accept these "legends"
as literal truth; and you will understand, from "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> Incarnation,"
that Jesus was not miraculously born any more than we all are.
Jesus never claimed it for himself, as you will find as you read
what I send you from time to time. It was a doctrine created by the
Church to suit later days. I was glad to have you speak freely of
yourself, and hope that we may make religion, the Bible, and Jesus,
natural, simple, true, and beautiful to you and your
daughter,&mdash;something that you can take hold of and live out in your
daily lives, and be thankful that you <i>live</i>. Hoping that you may
have further questions to ask, and wish to borrow books on subjects
of interest to you,</p>

<p class="right">Very truly your friend, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">S. Ellis</span>.</p>

<p>There is a book that will throw much light on your question
concerning the early view of Christ, "Orthodoxy and Heresy," by
Rev. E. H. Hall. We have it to loan.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p class="right"><span class="smcap">March</span> 13, 1884.</p>

<p>It is with pleasure I sit down to reply to your last letter, and it
has only been from total inability that you have had to wait so
long. I wanted to sit down immediately to send you a few
sympathetic words, for your life must have been very similar to my
own. The best comfort for us is, to say to ourselves, Are not many,
<i>many</i> others carrying the same burdens, disappointments, and toils
as we? How do they bear them, and where do they get their patience
and strength from? Only from studying the words and lives of those
who have had similar trials to bear; and no one bore the cross
better than He to whom the whole world has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> looked as a guide.
Therefore though you fall and fail often, be not in despair. All
you need is some one to speak with you who sympathizes with you;
and though they may not lighten your burden or change your
circumstances, they will lighten your heart and make the whole
world seem different to you, and full of work to be done, that will
take your thoughts out from beyond your own home, and yet at the
same time only make that all the more precious to you and just the
place you ought to be in. Am not fond of the country myself. Have
always lived in the city, and prefer to be surrounded by people and
life rather than trees and quiet of the country; still, I love to
visit in the country for a short time.... You ask how you can best
prepare yourself to become a member of our church. I sent you the
church programme, and Mr. Thayer says there, "Those who present
themselves in an earnest spirit,"&mdash;an earnest spirit to do all the
good you can, in every way, at home and to the world. It is
<i>character</i>, and <i>not</i> belief, which makes the true Christian. And
if our conscience is right before God, let man say what he will; if
we are only sure ourselves we are doing our best according to our
circumstances and our health; if our motives are pure and our
conscience clear,&mdash;we shall feel a pleasure in joining in a
Communion service, though one can be a member of our church if not
a communicant. There are several books I wish to recommend to you.
The first is a great help to inward strength, and is a gem of a
book, "Day unto Day," which consists of a passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> or two from the
Scriptures, a selection from poetry, and one from writers, for
every day in the year.... The whole book is full of selections
which fit the needs of every day. I have two copies, and will loan
you one copy with passages I have marked as read, and which has
benefited several of my correspondents.... Another great help to a
good life is Merriam's "Way of Life." "Theodore Parker's Prayers" I
can loan you too. Since I wrote you, have had presented to our
library Sunderland's "What is the Bible?" shorter than "Bible for
Learners," and on the whole better to read first. I subscribed for
the Sunday-school lessons on "The Life of Jesus," so any time you
are welcome to it. You will understand from what I have written,
that to strengthen the inner man is a good preparation for anything
and anywhere; and you will find a great deal among our books, and
in our papers, and in our religion, to help you and make life a
blessing, though under unfavorable circumstances, and enable you to
have the spirit and faith <i>of</i> Jesus, if not so much <i>in</i> Jesus,
which the Orthodox make most emphatic.</p></blockquote>

<p>The following letter was written June 27, 1885. The unusual allusions to
her own health are evidently in sympathy with the correspondent, who had
written of ill health and heavy burdens to bear.</p>

<blockquote><p>"I have been most useless since the middle of February; but, weak
as I am, I have insisted on staying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> out of bed, waiting on myself,
and keeping my room in order, even to sweeping it, and keeping up
my missionary work slowly. I do dislike to be nursed and a care to
people. Sometimes it seems impossible for me to get dressed for my
breakfast, and it takes me about one hour and a quarter, I am so
weak. Last Sunday I could not get to church; but I spent the day in
resting,&mdash;spiritual rest. I had a service at home,&mdash;the responsive
service, the three hymns, the Scripture lesson, and read one of J.
F. Clarke's sermons, which I sent to another who needed consoling.
There is a favorite hymn of mine, which I will write out for you.
We often sing it for an opening hymn. [The hymn "Daily
Consecration," by Caroline Mason, is here copied in full.] Excuse
the mistakes, for I have written it from memory. Work on, dear
friend, just where you are, and feel that there you are casting
silent deeds of love which no one knows but the good Father above,
but that they are none the less earnest work in his service....
Every other Saturday A. M. I go to the church to do up papers for
the Workhouse. Was there <i>this</i> morning. Take heart, good friend,
and feel that nothing you do is lost, and that sometime your labor
will be appreciated. I must not write longer, for I want to attend
church to-morrow. They miss me when I am not at my post."</p></blockquote>

<p>Another letter of this summer reads:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;Your letter was duly received, and I wanted to
answer it immediately, but have been too weak to write <i>comforting</i>
letters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>Am so sorry to hear you are still sick, and wish I could help you.
Am still more sorry to hear you are "dreading" the summer; but I do
not wonder at it, for on a farm the labor required by the women in
the house must be incessant.... I cannot take the burden off your
shoulders; but perhaps a word of sympathy from another, and
something from her experience, may enable you to face the
difficulties.... My experience has been that when anticipating a
hard time, if I only accept it, and make up my mind that it <i>has</i> to
be my part, half the burden is taken off, if I determine to go
through with it all, giving myself up to that work and thinking of
nothing beyond in the mean time. Take all the rest I can get,
instead of trying to do something else too. Rest will do you more
good than company or books, when you are so used up with real hard
work. Women all try to attend to too much outside of their
households, for the sake of company and variety; do you not think
so? Now, just take things as quietly as you can this summer, and
feel that in your home duties you have more than you can do, and
look forward to the time when summer will be over and you will have
less care.</p></blockquote>

<p>After her death, the lady wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I sent my letter to her home by a messenger who reported that he
understood at the door, as he handed it to the person who answered
the bell, that Miss Ellis was dead. I hoped that he was mistaken,
but your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> letter confirmed it. I knew she was very feeble. She
wrote me some two weeks before Christmas, saying she was very weak;
but I did not think for one moment that she was in danger, or I
would have hurried to see her. I shall miss her greatly, and her
dear letters to me, which I prized so highly; and you, who saw more
of her than I could possibly, will feel her loss greatly. I believe
there are few persons capable of entering so entirely into sympathy
with others who needed it as she was, and of giving such
consolation; at least, it has not been my good fortune to meet many
such. I will be glad to receive the memorial of which you speak. I
shall be very glad if your minister would write me on the subject
of joining the church, as I was depending on Miss Ellis to guide me
in the matter, which she was ready to do one year or more ago."</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1884 Miss Ellis received the following letter from a young man, Mr.
A. J. Beach, who had been one of her discouragements, because, after
some correspondence, she had ceased to hear from him. Mr. Beach was
usher in the State Penitentiary at Joliet, Ill.</p>

<blockquote><p>"More than a year ago I wrote to thank you for papers which you had
kindly sent me. In answer, you sent me a very kind letter, and
named several books which I might read with profit. I procured a
number of Rev. James Freeman Clarke's works, which I read
carefully, and from which I gathered much of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> great value. I also
subscribed to two of the papers you named, to which I have become
so much attached that I could not possibly do without them.... Your
letter led me to a course of reading and investigation that has
proved a sun-burst to me. I have been in darkness. I am out of it
now. I am connected with the State Prison (as usher), not the
pleasantest position in the world; but I have tried to show many of
the poor convicts the better way of life, and to cheer them by kind
words and a showing of real interest in their unfortunate
condition, and I believe I have succeeded in making lighter many a
poor friendless fellow's load...."</p></blockquote>

<p>The following extracts are from others of his letters:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I have read the sermons, and have handed them to a very
intelligent prisoner, who has become greatly interested in
Unitarian teachings, and requested him to pass the documents to
others, after reading them. He will do so, and will see that they
are kept moving. I am glad you are taking so much interest in our
prison. There is much need of genuine kindness here, and it cannot
be better shown than in a true and apparent desire to raise the
unfortunates to a higher plane of thought and action. These men and
women are in a sense left to themselves. They are not permitted to
talk to each other. They pass long hours in their cells either
reading or thinking. Is it not the very time to get them started
thinking in the right direction? You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> say, We shall write to the
Secretary of the Women's Auxiliary Conference in Boston, ... and
interest them in the Joliet prison. This is good news. The Post
Office Mission is truly a grand mission, and is doing more good
than you may think of."</p></blockquote>

<p>The next letter says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The papers and tracts you have been kind enough to send me have
been given to prisoners, and they have been passed from hand to
hand until literally worn out. There are a great many very
intelligent men among the fifteen hundred and fifty convicts now in
our prison, and they (or many of them, at least) are very glad to
get such papers and tracts as you have sent me; and I am only too
glad to place such reading matter in their hands. You asked if old
'Registers' and 'Unities' would do any good. They would be
thankfully received by many of the unfortunate men, and would be
carefully read by them. Reading is one of the very few privileges
granted convicts.... I to-day received from Mrs. Thacher, of
Boston, a bill of lading for two barrels of papers and magazines
shipped for distribution among prisoners; also a kind and very
interesting letter from Mrs. Thacher,&mdash;for all of which I am
indebted to you. I am glad, indeed, Unitarian people understand
that convicts want and appreciate something more in reading matter
than chilling tracts. We are constantly receiving for distribution
the strongest kind of Orthodoxy, but the prisoners do not seem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
take kindly to it.... An old colored man, who was sent here eleven
years ago under life sentence, said to me yesterday, 'I tell yo',
sah, it seems mighty ha'd to sarve in hell all yo' life in dis
place, an' den have to take it for sartin' su'ah in de nex' worl'.'
He seemed to think that a sentence to the penitentiary was merely
carrying out a part of the divine plan; in other words, he was
foreordained to eternal suffering, and has got eleven years on his
way.... We found the books and papers to be all that could be
desired, and have taken great pleasure in distributing them....
Could you have heard the genuine thankfulness expressed by the
unfortunate prisoners as I passed along the galleries distributing
the reading matter, you surely would have felt amply repaid for
interesting yourself in them.... Many said, 'God bless the ladies
who thought of us!' with an earnestness and sincerity which
indicated clearly to me that they felt and appreciated the kindness
and the motives of the donors. My experience among convicts has
convinced me that kindness shown toward them is never wasted. There
are in this prison several noted criminals,&mdash;men who have the
reputation of being brutal desperadoes,&mdash;with whom I have
frequently talked, and have invariably found to be easily touched
by a kind word and act."</p></blockquote>

<p>Last June Mr. Beach dropped dead in a Chicago depot while on his way
home. It seems proper to copy here portions of a letter written to his
family by the chaplain of the prison.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p class="right"><span class="smcap">June</span> 30, 1885.</p>

<p>... As we roomed together, I was with him more than any one else;
and when not otherwise engaged, we read and talked together.... We
were very frank with each other, and last Sabbath eve we had a long
talk on religion. The reaction from a Calvinistic faith had
evidently left him somewhat adrift. We talked of the cramping of
creeds on the one hand, and the tendency on the other hand of
(so-called) Liberal views to produce loose morals, etc. He dwelt on
the fact that the perceptions of the mind were so much in advance
of the inclinations of the heart, that men knew better than they
did; adding, "Oh, I have often come so near to the wonderful
process by which bad men are made good!" I reminded him that Paul
said, "It is nigh thee, even in thy mouth and in thy
heart,"&mdash;dwelling at length on the whole argument in Romans x. 6 to
13 inclusive. I remarked that my habit of urging these views
earnestly for forty-four years might have become obtrusive; but he
answered: "No; if these things are worth anything, they are worth
everything. If duty here affects destiny there, these are matters
of primary and not secondary consideration." Little did I think
then that in twelve brief hours he would know their reality better
than I possibly could. In saying good-by [the chaplain adds], he
said he would write soon, was glad he had ever known me, but feared
he <i>would not see me again</i>; then walked off feebly but cheerfully
with &mdash;&mdash;, who carried his satchel, and to whom he was much
attached&mdash;though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> a colored convict, yet much of a man. At 7:30 A.
M. he went with Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;, our purchasing agent, with whom he
talked freely <i>en route</i> to Chicago, who carried his satchel,
helped him up the stairs in the depot, and at whose feet he
suddenly dropped dead. A physician was called at once, but
paralysis of the heart had stopped the wheel of life.... The boys
here loved him <i>much</i>. B&mdash;&mdash;, a special friend, gave him a pretty
onyx cross for his little niece. I think he put it in his pocket.
Some Boston ladies sent him several boxes of pamphlets and books
for the library, advising him to keep certain volumes himself, and
I hoped he had written his name in them or set them aside; yet
C&mdash;&mdash; (colored) and T. J. D&mdash;&mdash;, who aided him in the library (and
mourn him as a brother) think he read the volumes they recommended,
but made no further claim on them. Some prison employees, like some
physicians, find their sympathies decrease by constant use. <i>He</i>
was not so; for there was not a drop of tyranny or despotism in his
blood, and any one who used power simply to oppress another was
beneath his contempt. He could consistently say to the Recording
Angel, "Mark me as one who loves my fellow-men." Oh! had I known
all he probably meant when he said so tenderly at parting, "I fear
we will not meet again," I would have followed out the impulse of
my heart, clasped him in my arms, and then have said (as I did),
"Yes, we will meet in heaven!"</p></blockquote>

<p>The following extracts are from Miss Ellis's letters to Beach:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="right"><span class="smcap">December</span> 23, 1884.</p>

<p>Your letter was received last Saturday afternoon, and was quite
encouraging to us, for we may do some good work in the prison with
one who feels interested with us. Your letter was particularly
welcome, as the same morning came a letter from Mrs. J. I. W.
Thacher, Secretary of the Women's Auxiliary Conference of Boston,
who responded promptly and satisfactorily to my letter, though she
was sick in bed. After the hurry of Christmas is over, they will
send you two barrels of literature,&mdash;"Registers," "Harpers,"
"Centuries," "Atlantics," and some few other materials. I feel as
if this will be "good news" to you. Yes; it is a good time to turn
the minds of the men, women, and boys in the right direction. "A
little kindness" and good advice may help some of the poor
creatures to a better life. Think Orthodoxy takes a wrong
starting-point in teaching one that he is "totally depraved," and
that he must wait for a sudden conversion in order to become good.
I feel as if Unitarianism is the better way, upholding that we are
"not totally depraved, but incompletely developed," and that our
salvation depends greatly upon individual responsibility. That we
have it within ourselves to become what God intended we should be,
and what was possible with Jesus is with us,&mdash;that we may become
"sons of God" as he was. We are not to "shift the responsibility
off on to some one else," as M. J. Savage says. These poor
creatures must be taught that the sin is greatly on their own
shoulders, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> they are capable of overcoming if they only will.
Mr. Savage's closing sentence is fine,&mdash;"Not to do wrong, one must
develop in himself the ability of magnificent self-control!" That
is the starting-point of many of life's failures,&mdash;lack of
self-control. Teach these poor creatures that lesson, and some
trade by which they can support themselves when they leave the
prison. You wrote us word you subscribed to two of our papers. I
take it for granted they are the "Register" and "Unity." If so,
will call your attention to a review of a book on "Prison Reform,"
in "Unity," Dec. 16, 1884. I sent you yesterday a tract, "Unitarian
Belief in Bible Language," marking several passages which I thought
might rouse some of the poor men and women and <i>boys</i> (it is the
<i>young</i> we must work on, and see to it that we are making better
men and women for the future) to a truer view of what sin is; also,
"Wrestling and Blessing," by Rev. William C. Gannett. His first
section, on "Inherited Burden," is capital, showing that in spite
of it we may come off "conquerors." The whole of the tract is
good.... Hoping we may continue to aid you in the prison work, and
with the good wishes of the season from the Women's Auxiliary
Conference to you and all prison-workers and inmates,</p>

<p class="right">Cordially yours,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">S. Ellis</span>.</p></blockquote>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<blockquote><p class="right"><span class="smcap">February</span> 5, 1885.</p>

<p>If we can only make men feel their bodies are temples of the Holy
Spirit, which they have of God, and that they are not their own,
and that in sinning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> they disgrace this holy temple, it seems to me
that there would be less crime in the world. It is the divine in
their own souls they defile. There has been a tract of Unitarian
hymns published. I will send you a copy next week, hoping that some
of our beautiful hymns may cheer the poor benighted prisoners.... I
have had people say to me, "The Unitarian faith does very well to
live by daily; but when you are in trouble, or your friends die, if
you do not believe in the Trinity, what have you to comfort you?"
My reply is, "We have God, from whom Jesus received <i>his</i> strength.
We have the faith <i>of</i> Jesus, and not so much faith <i>in</i> Jesus. We
can trust <i>God</i> to help us in our hour of need; and if we have
sinned we know <i>He</i> is ready and willing to pardon us. We know that
to live truly in this life will secure us happiness in the world to
come; and that while we are here there is time to repent and do
good, and we would not wish to feel that it was necessary for a
perfect being to die to spare us from our sins. We had rather
suffer on, if we have done the wrong, than see some one else suffer
for us."</p></blockquote>

<p>On receiving the news of Mr. Beach's sudden death in July, 1885, Miss
Ellis wrote to his sister:</p>

<blockquote><p>"... I was much shocked and very sorry to hear the news your
letter, which was received this morning, contained, but was much
obliged to you for speaking so plainly of your dear brother, for I
was much interested in him. Not only I, but <i>all</i> of our little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
Women's Auxiliary Conference, and also the ladies of the Auxiliary
Conference in Boston. He was a noble fellow, and doing much good
there in the Joliet prison. I hope to transfer my esteem and
respect for him to his family in remembrance of him. How little it
ever occurred to me, when I wrote the letter to him on the 20th,
that the dear fellow was safe in his heavenly home. I am sure he
deserved a high place with the dear ones above, in whatever faith
he died. He used to write us such good, interesting letters, both
here and to Boston. We were always glad to get them.... I never
have known to what church he and his family belong, but have
imagined the Presbyterian.... What church do you attend, and how
old was Andrew? I am old enough to be his mother, I suspect, and
looked upon him and some few other of my correspondents as 'my
boys,' as one of my converts styles himself. My hope was that
Andrew would study for the ministry some day.... I know what sorrow
is, but must say yours is one of the most trying ordeals to pass
through,&mdash;an only son, and such a noble one, to die among
strangers. My heart aches sorely for you, and I do not wonder it
seems like a 'dream' to you. We do not know and cannot tell why our
dear ones are taken. We can only trust in God's love to lighten the
burden for us after a time, and accept our present trial. The
spirit of the dear ones will help us to be kinder and more loving
to those who are left with us; and gradually a change comes over
us, and as days roll on we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> find our lives are very different from
what they were before,&mdash;purer and holier, and we have been drawn
nearer heaven and been with our dear one all the time. I will copy
a beautiful poem of Whittier's, 'The Angel of Patience,' at the
close of this letter. 'Our earthly loss is our heavenly gain.' ...
Bear as bravely as you can, and the good Father will send peace to
your souls as the years roll on. 'We must through much tribulation
enter the kingdom of heaven.' We shall be glad to send papers to
<i>you</i> now. I think in the 'Register' you will find many things to
comfort you often; and from time to time I will select something
especial for you. Let me know, please, by postal, if you prefer not
to have them. Shall be very glad to hear from you any time."</p></blockquote>

<p>This letter led to a correspondence continued until Miss Ellis's death,
and to the sending of much literature to the family. Further extracts
from this correspondence follow:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="right"><span class="smcap">August</span> 16, 1885.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p><p>... I do not wonder you miss the dear brother, and feel grieved that
you may not see him again. I do not believe the good Father in
heaven is angry if we murmur some. He cannot be so harsh as to have
us cultivate family affections and friendships on earth and not have
any loving feelings left. No! It is right to mourn, but yet "not
without hope." One of the most beautiful sermons I ever heard, and
the most comforting, was one from our pastor, Rev. C. W. Wendte, on
"The Dark Hours of Life, and what they bring us."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here she copies the closing passages of the sermon, and also four pages
of poems,&mdash;"The Heart Prayer," by J. N. Spriggs; "I am so Weak," Jennie
E. McCaine, both from "Unity Songs Resung;" "My Dead," by Rev. F. L.
Hosmer; and selections from "Scriptures Old and New." So little did she
spare the feeble remains of her strength in these last months. Sept. 27,
1885, she wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"... Not that I have so much to do, but this changeable weather has
unfitted me for work, and I have a good deal of extra work lately,
that has exercised my brain considerably and required <i>long</i>
letters. I was put on a committee of three at the St. Louis
Conference last May, for drawing up systematic Post Office Mission
methods. Rev. Arthur Judy, of Davenport, Iowa, is the chairman. He
has planned a circular letter and a book of records. It has taken
much of my time to read the long letters and give my opinion of
them.... We have to work very differently in this region....
However, in time we shall have more than one enlightened family in
a place. The way to overcome is to lend our papers, tracts, books,
etc., that the people may see we are Christians after all. We do
not want to convert them so much, but to make more sincere
Christians of them, and happier people in this world; and by
degrees they throw aside their old dogmas without knowing it. We do
have so many comforting books; so many good Sunday-school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> lessons
adapted to grown people even; devotional books, too, with
selections which fit each day; and also so many books containing a
true account of Unitarianism and of the Bible, that I feel every
one ought to read them, and own many; but of course they cannot....
I want to lend you a little daily book I have,&mdash;'Day unto Day.' It
is in rather a dilapidated state, because I have sent it by mail to
a number of persons. I have two copies, but both birthday presents,
and I do not like to part with either. The pencil-marks in it are
mine, as they have impressed me day by day. You may retain it three
or four months if you wish."</p></blockquote>

<p>The sister wrote in reply:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="right"><span class="smcap">October</span> 27,1886.</p>

<p>I wish to thank you especially for the loan of your book, "Day unto
Day." It was very kind in you, and I have found it to be a perfect
mine of beautiful gems of truth and wisdom, and "day unto day" it
can furnish comforting thought for all occasions.</p>

<p>I was very much interested in your statement of your work as a
member of the committee you mentioned. Certainly, such an amount of
such elevating literature distributed so extensively must result in
much good. The literature that I receive from you we endeavor to
make the very best use of,&mdash;by first "thoroly" reading in our own
family, and then lending to those among our neighbors and friends
who will be most likely to give their attention to it. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> one or
two occasions we have invited in, on Sunday afternoons, some of our
neighbors, and made them occasions for reading to them an especially
good sermon or article, hoping to awaken sufficient interest to
perhaps have frequent readings and talks. In our village there are
two churches only,&mdash;the Disciples and Presbyterian.</p></blockquote>

<p>The date of Miss Ellis's last letter to this correspondent shows it to
have been written less than a month before her death:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="right"><span class="smcap">November</span> 30, 1885.</p>

<p>Your letter was very welcome, and I intended replying sooner; but
for the last three weeks have been very miserable, though up, out,
and at work all the time, accomplishing little, however. We were so
glad to hear you were occasionally having Sunday readings and doing
the good you can. To-day I have mailed to you "Songs of Faith, Hope,
and Charity," and the last Church Door Pulpit "Channing," selected
by Mr. Gannett, whose father, Ezra S. Gannett, was Dr. Channing's
colleague for many years. It is an admirable compilation, and I wish
it were in small book form, for it would make a very beautiful
little Christmas gift. Even in this form I shall use it for such a
purpose. There are three books I would call your and your friends'
attention to as little gifts of value at this season; namely, "Daily
Strength for Daily Needs;" "The Thought of God in Hymns and Poems,"
by Rev. F. L. Hosmer and Rev. William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> C. Gannett, just published;
then there is a pleasant story-book for boys or girls published last
year, "The Browns." ... All this may be quite contrary to your
feelings this year, and I presume you cannot enter into Thanksgiving
and Christmas with the real spirit of former days. But not as you
see the "golden lining" to all things can you give way to gloom.
There is always <i>something</i> to be grateful for. How much worse
<i>might</i> have happened to us. Then, too, we can feel thankful that we
had our treasures so long, and that they were such a pleasure to us.
Thanksgiving naturally makes us ask, "What have I to be thankful
for?" and makes us somewhat sad; but at Christmas we lay aside all
thought of self, and think of Him who was all unselfishness; and in
this thought we try to forget our sorrows in order to send gladness
thrilling through some other human soul, and thus forget our loss
for that day at least, though tears may come involuntarily. Hope the
Thanksgiving was as pleasant as it could be; that there was a
reunion of those of you who are still living, and that the spirit of
the dear one only drew you all together in stronger bonds of love.
We&mdash;father, mother, and myself&mdash;were invited to dine with my
brother&mdash;&mdash;, there to meet my dear sister's husband and five
motherless children. It is the one pleasure to us to pass these
anniversaries together, and to feel all our dear ones are with us in
spirit, bidding us to be of "good cheer," for they are not dead, but
with their love for us would guide us on to better things than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
<i>they</i> ever knew or could accomplish. All is well with them now, and
they look down smilingly upon our feeblest efforts to do the right
and be cheery.</p></blockquote>

<p>The sister wrote, Feb. 7, 1886:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"... We were very much shocked when we heard of the death of Miss
Ellis. We had known that she was an invalid, yet, judging from her
letters, we had no idea of the great weakness she must have endured
physically in writing to her correspondents up to so recent a date.
Her letters to us in our great bereavement were so full of tender
sympathy with us, and were so comforting, we feel that we have
sustained a great loss, even though we had never seen her.... It
will be a pleasure to us to forward to you any letters of Miss
Ellis either to my brother or myself that will aid you in the
publication of a book ... that will extend and perpetuate the
influence of so useful and good a life."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mrs. J. I. W. Thacher wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="right"><span class="smcap">February</span> 17, 1886.</p>

<p>You will be glad to know that we have had very grateful letters from
the several stations in Kentucky to which we have sent barrels of
magazines and papers. To Eddyville and Greenwood we have sent twice;
and Dr. R&mdash;&mdash;(at the latter place) still says, "Send more whenever
it is convenient;" so that we feel that the very miscellaneous
collections have been really appreciated and enjoyed. In each barrel
we sent large numbers of "Registers" and some good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> tracts, and then
filled in with miscellaneous magazines,&mdash;chiefly the illustrated
ones. This is hardly Post Office Mission work, but I don't doubt it
accomplishes much good, and I am always grateful to you and Miss
Ellis for suggesting it to us.... Do you continue to be in
communication with the Joliet Penitentiary, and is any one keeping
on with Mr. Beach's work for the prisoners? It is a constant help
and inspiration,&mdash;the thought of Miss Ellis's devotion to her work
and her faithfulness to the end!</p></blockquote>

<p>A young Englishman in Frankfort, Ky., wrote Mrs. Hunert, in answer to
her card of inquiry:</p>

<blockquote><p>"I do take the 'Register,' 'Unity,' and 'Unitarian;' I am almost
entirely dependent upon what I read here, as I can hear no Liberal
preaching, and meet with very few who have sympathy with Liberal
religious views. I did get the memorial of Miss Ellis, and will
prize it much, as I was better acquainted with her than any one
connected with the church at Cincinnati, and looked upon her as one
of my best friends, and a very noble lady. The day on which I
received your postal, I met the chaplain of the penitentiary here,
and he told me how much the Unitarian literature that was sent from
the East was liked by him; that it was all distributed, and enjoyed
very much by the inmates of the prison. If I had another copy or
two of Miss Ellis's memorial, I would give one to the chaplain, and
another gentleman,&mdash;about the only Unitarian I know here."</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>The following correspondence is with a workingman in Northern Ohio,&mdash;a
young Englishman, whose letters tell his story. He once rose at four
o'clock to write Miss Ellis before going to his daily work. One of his
first letters to her said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="right"><span class="smcap">March</span> 16, 1885.</p>

<p>Now, that you may know in what walk of life I move, I must tell you
that I am a laborer. When working by the month, my wages never
exceeded twelve dollars a month. From such small wages I have built
up a small library of 155 volumes; have also 156 pamphlets. I take
unceasing delight in reading, and now that I have others dependent
on me, am not able to procure all the books I need. By some I have
been encouraged to prepare for the ministry. Such also is my
aspiration. It may be years before I shall become a minister,
because my preparation is not to be accomplished very quickly. Oh,
how I wish that some one from their abundance would forward me some
of the books and pamphlets they have cast aside, having no further
use for! They would be of great use to me. What are the
qualifications necessary for the Unitarian ministry? Will you please
tell me? If possible for you to do so, please send me a few more
sermons by Rev. G. A. Thayer, and I shall be greatly obliged.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Miss Ellis forwarded this letter to Miss M. O. Rogers, Secretary of the
King's Chapel branch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> the Women's Auxiliary Conference, Boston,
Mass., who had written, offering aid in her work. As a result, the
King's Chapel Women's Auxiliary Conference sent this young man many
Unitarian books of value, and the "Unitarian Review" regularly, for
which his gratitude was great. He loans and distributes all matter sent
him, and has procured many tracts from the American Unitarian
Association for distribution. A portion of Miss Ellis's reply to the
letter given above is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="right"><span class="smcap">March</span> 18,1885.</p>

<p>Your letter was read with much interest, and we are glad to know our
"little society has done good work."... Don't be discouraged if you
cannot convert the world at once, but wait quietly till your time
comes to do more. You are young yet. Think I can spare a few more of
Mr. Thayer's sermons. He has only had four sermons on "Reasonable
Religion" published.... Will send you the Meadville catalogue next
week, and you can see for yourself, and afterwards write to
President A. A. Livermore, telling him I sent you the catalogue. He
can give you all further information. He was the pastor in
Cincinnati from the time I was fourteen to twenty-one, and knows us
well.... Hope to hear further from you occasionally. Work on
quietly, knowing the discipline will the better fit you for
ministerial labors. We can't jump into the highest calling on earth
in a moment, and now-a-days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> a man must be something of more than
ordinary ability to enter a Unitarian pulpit. It is not an easy
place to fill.
</p></blockquote>

<p>He wrote to her, June 14, 1885:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Believe me, I am sorry to hear that you were 'too sick to more
than keep up' with your work. I know you must be busy at all times,
from the report of your work in the Conference 'Unity' you sent me.
That number of 'Unity' is very valuable to me, and will be kept for
future reference. The four sermons on 'Reasonable Religion,' by
Rev. George A. Thayer, have also been kept. I hope soon to see them
in a neat binding. They are worthy of the expense. Of the books
received from Boston, four have been read by me. Two of them were
mostly read as I walked to my work mornings. In the same manner
'Meditations on the Essence of Christianity' was read. This book is
very beautiful, its author, Robert Laird Collier. 'Channing's
Works' and 'Genuineness of the Gospels' cannot be carried about as
readily, so they are to be read and studied on lost days, when I
cannot work. The 'Reviews' received are very valuable; I would not
part with them for anything. The 'Register' is received regularly
from Philadelphia. The last one is very interesting, containing as
it does an account of the Festival. It must have been good to be
there. To you, and all who have aided you in your generosity to me,
I return my heartfelt thanks."</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>After Miss Ellis's death, he wrote, Feb. 13, 1886:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"... With this I send you the whole of her correspondence to me,
hoping that you may find something that will be of use to you. I
cheerfully send you the letter and postals, knowing that my
treasures will be in safe keeping. Since Miss Ellis's death they
are doubly precious to me; I prize them very highly, because she
who wrote them proved herself to be a very dear friend to me,&mdash;a
laborer longing for more light. Whilst I live I shall never forget
how much I owe to her who labored so much in my behalf. It was the
one wish of my heart to have met Miss Ellis, and to have thanked
her for all that she had done for me; but it was to be otherwise.
When I meet her in the country of 'many mansions,' I shall have the
opportunity to do so. I believe I shall meet and know her there.
Your offer of help is very kind; my greatest drawback is lack of
books by Unitarian writers. I buy when I can, but being out of
work&mdash;that is, steady work&mdash;since last September makes it very hard
work to get a book very often. If you can help me in this way I
shall be very thankful, and if you cannot, I shall be just the
same, because I feel that you would if you could. I have much
opposition to overcome, standing alone in my belief in the truth of
Unitarianism. I have great need of more books. My preparation for
the ministry must necessarily be slow, because I can never attend
Meadville Theological College. But I am reminded that your time is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
precious, and so I will close. Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, will you at the next
meeting of the Women's Auxiliary Conference thank all the dear
friends who have done so much for me? If I ever amount to much in
life I shall owe it all to the Cincinnati branch of the Women's
Auxiliary Conference. Hoping that you will not forget me when
sending out literature, I remain, etc."</p></blockquote>

<p>In another letter he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"My object in fitting myself for the ministry is to be able to
carry the message of Unitarianism to my brother-laborers, because I
believe it will make better men&mdash;and women too&mdash;of them.... I began
to work when I was but a little more than eleven years old, and
since that time I have been my own teacher."</p></blockquote>

<p>A lady in Ohio sends her "Register" regularly (the arrangement being
made through Miss Ellis) to the correspondent who wrote her this letter
of thanks:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I have long postponed the note of thanks I have meant to send you.
But when I tell you that I am a dressmaker, you will pardon me, I
am sure. This is my harvest season, and I am extremely busy. Being
one of the class of work-women who put <i>themselves</i> into what they
do, I am exhausted at night, and forced to make Sunday a day of
rest indeed.</p>

<p>"The papers do come regularly, to my great joy. I assure you that
the pleasure and spiritual strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> I get from them, if you could
realize it, would compensate you for the trouble an hundred-fold. My
business, showing me so plainly the small foibles and weaknesses of
human nature, and necessarily binding one's thoughts in large
measure to 'band, gusset, and seam, seam, gusset, and band,' or
their equivalents of flounces and gores, tends to a wearisome
narrowing of the mind; a half-hour spent after work is done, with
the 'Register,' opens a window, as it were, into heaven.</p>

<p>"I live alone. At times my isolation is hard to bear; but having
seen better days, as the saying goes, to me my deprivations are but
part of the discipline that God saw was needful for me. I am shut
off, by reason of serving the public, from the society of my equals
in education and breeding, and for that of my equals in station I
have no taste. <i>Pardonnez-moi</i> these personal details; I give them
that you may know how much good you are doing. Long may you be
spared the power and the will to do such kindness to those who need.
We may never meet on earth, but I trust we shall in heaven."
</p></blockquote>

<p>To Miss Ellis, Aug. 20, 1885, she wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I receive the papers, and not only read and enjoy them, but give
and send them to others. I am surprised to find 'unconscious'
Unitarians wherever I go. I hope you may be well by this time. Do
not tire yourself to write. Others need you more than I."</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>After Miss Ellis's death, she wrote acknowledging the memorial:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Many thanks. I was so glad to receive it, and prize it as one of
my treasures; also for the welcome tracts and papers. They are like
the shadow of a great rock in a weary land to me, and are given
away to others."</p></blockquote>

<p>A woman in a small Indiana village wrote Miss Ellis:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I understand you have Liberal literature that you send gratis to
hungry people who are not able to gratify their appetite in that
direction. It would be greatly appreciated by me, and after reading
I would put it where I thought it would do the most good."</p></blockquote>

<p>Later, she wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I have received a paper and often something else every other week.
These I have accepted as a kind of trust; and when there has been a
favorable opportunity, given them away to friends and
acquaintances. I do not press them on any one, nor talk about it
much. I have not the courage of a reformer. When I speak to friends
(that are kind every other way) of a broader religious belief, they
meet me with coldness and distrust. It chills me, and I am silent.
Yet I believe, with Helen Williams, if any one is brought to face a
great truth, if they accept it, yet do not speak or act upon it,
there is retribution, barrenness, for them,&mdash;a plunging in the
whale's belly, as Jonah was,&mdash;a figure so many have laughed at, yet
significant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> for all that. I wonder now at my struggles in former
years; am happier since the tangled skein is partially
straightened. Still I am not fully in accord with the Unitarians.
Miss &mdash;&mdash; [another correspondent in the same village] spoke to me
some time ago of your desiring us to form a reading circle. I do
not know what she said to you. I will give you the situation. I
live in a small village of about one hundred inhabitants, and Miss
&mdash;&mdash; lives about two miles away. I cannot call to mind a woman that
would take any interest. They would go to sleep over their
knitting, or want to use the time for social chat, as they do not
meet day after day at the village store, as the men do (I speak of
winter). True, there are a few that would enjoy the reading, yet
are so severely Orthodox they could not comprehend a new truth
outside of <i>their</i> church. That is the dark side. Now I have often
thought if we had a place of meeting, where we could seat a small
audience (which we have not), and a good reader (ditto), we could
call them together Sunday afternoons and read some of the beautiful
sermons you have sent.</p>

<p>"Your work is grand,&mdash;the elevation of the human race. The ones that
<i>will</i> read, will become better, kindlier, more patient with
ignorance; and while they yearn to give every soul a chance, will
naturally throw out a better influence and teach a broader religion.
As to your paper, not now. It is midwinter; husband, carpenter, out
of employment. Intend to take one of your publications after a
while."</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>About two weeks after Miss Ellis's death she addressed this letter to
her:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I received a "Register" yesterday, directed in a
different hand. Are you sick? I hope not. I should grieve indeed if
I knew that physical pain had stopped your work. These lines come
to my mind:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Only a woman, and I could not find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The quiet household life that women know;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So too, my part where there were sheaves to bind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not much, perhaps, but more than I could do.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My tired feet failed me in the harvest lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My ripened grain but half-way reaped across;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, where it dropped from over-wearied hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My best sheaf lies half bound for winds to toss."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Instead, may you continue your work till eventide.</p>

<p>Who can tell, when a mind gives up its beliefs, where it will stop?
I seem to believe nothing, unless it is in the Supreme Good,
whatever that is,&mdash;and my religion, to live the best life I know.
The Orthodox preachers say if one strays from the "path," or
"back-slides," they are always uneasy and unhappy. How different my
experience is! How glad I am to have escaped the little enclosure of
dogma, and to stand "far indeed from being wise, but free to learn"!</p>

<p>Hoping this will find you in good health and spirits, I remain</p>

<p class="right">Your friend &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&mdash;&mdash; C&mdash;&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>After hearing of Miss Ellis's death, she wrote:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>"Received your postal. Have also received Unitarian papers, and
Miss Ellis's memorial, which last I will store among my treasured
mementos. How beautiful her life was! Though never having seen her,
she will be treasured in my memory as a dear friend. She has sent
me almost all the pamphlets, I suppose, that have been written for
the purpose of distributing. Having a large family, they have been
read and reread, and handed to neighbors and friends. One has no
idea how many they will reach, or how much they influence; and yet
there is so much prejudice against Unitarians among Orthodox
Christians, some would take it as an insult to offer them one of
the pamphlets. In our little village the 'United Brethren' have
been holding meetings day and night for three weeks, and oh! how
they do preach hell, and pray publicly for 'that lady that is
leading her daughters down to hell,' simply because she does not
believe as they do. I have more tolerance for them than they have
for me. I think there are some people they will reach and do good,
as I presume the Rev. Sam Jones is doing in Cincinnati."</p></blockquote>

<p>The following letter to Miss Ellis from a poor old woman to whom she
wrote, sent papers and other aid, for several years, is given
<i>verbatim</i>, to illustrate the range of her sympathies. This letter was
also written after Miss Ellis's death:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I wish I could come and see you, but I cannot afford to go up and
down on the Trains. I have to send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> by someone, now Miss Ellis you
have been a sending me good Papers to read and now you must not
think I mean to beg but you sent me a New years Card it was a Rose
now I would not take anything for it I am as Foolish as Littel
Children is about Pictures the Rose I have is in my Album and if
you got any one by you to part With Will you send it to me for this
New year I feel more than thankful for the Papers you have sent
me.... Well I will close Write to me soon I am alone day and night
So goodbye from a Dear Friend to one I Love."</p></blockquote>

<p>A young man in a State Normal School in Indiana long corresponded with
Miss Ellis. He has been an enthusiastic distributor of our literature,
and instrumental in procuring Unitarian preaching in his city. Extracts
from his letters are here given.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The papers received are read by myself and others. There are few
here who know anything of what Unitarians believe."</p></blockquote>

<p>A second letter says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The matter sent to me is read by several persons. I think of one
young man now who asked me to send you his name. He said he would
like to read literature made by persons who are independent of
creeds. I gave him Wendte's 'Statement' and Chadwick's 'Art of
Life.'</p>

<p>"I am grateful to you for your kindness, and shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> be glad to
receive what you may send. I read the sermons by Savage with
interest. They were the only ones of his I ever saw. I have given
and shall continue to give the matter sent me wider circulation.
[Mentioning a rebuff recently received, he continues:] This little
experience, while not pleasant, is valuable to me. I see that the
spirit of the Middle Ages is not entirely dead yet, and that one
better not be too hasty. My convictions are just as strong as
before."</p></blockquote>

<p>Another letter says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I know something of what it costs to break away from old
associations. I was brought up in the Baptist Church. All my family
were of that faith.... My relatives all look upon me as one lost to
all true belief, because I cannot see my way clear to go with them
in the traditions of the fathers. Still, I feel that to be true to
the light I have is better than to have the sanction of those who
are simply following what their creed teaches, asking no questions.
I do not care to argue with them, and so follow that life that
gives me the greatest comfort and satisfaction."</p></blockquote>

<p>Feb. 11, 1886, he wrote Mrs. Hunert:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Miss Ellis was a very dear friend (although I never saw her), and
it was a great shock to learn of her decease. The first intimation
I had of her death was the article in the 'Register' headed 'A
Candle of the Lord.' Whatever literature you may send me shall be
given circulation after I have read it. I now supply some
half-dozen persons by mail with the tracts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> sent me. As I know the
personal peculiarities of all these parties, I can adapt the matter
to each. You will see, therefore, that I am a sort of branch
'mission.' In addition to this, I occasionally write a short
article to a local paper in Wayne County upon subjects of
interest."</p></blockquote>

<p>He encloses one of these articles,&mdash;subject, "Future or Everlasting
Punishment: Which?"</p>

<blockquote><p>"... Mrs. Smith wrote to me in regard to Miss Ellis's letters. I am
very sorry not to have any of them. During the last three years I
have moved so frequently, being sometimes in this State and
sometimes in W. Virginia, that they were lost, and I am unable to
find them. Some of them I carried for a long time in my pocket
until they became so worn as to be scarcely recognizable. The form
of them has vanished, but the kindness and sympathy they breathed
is with me still. The spirit of that sainted woman cannot wax old.
I humbly trust that I may be imbued with something of the calm and
trust and purity which her letters always suggested. There was,
too, an enthusiasm which was untiring, and withal a modesty that
never was absent from her utterances. There was ever the absence of
anything like dictation in her advice. It was the gentle monition
of a friend, never the pompous dictation of conscious superiority.
Rev. J. T. Sunderland, of Chicago, is to preach in our city March
21. I have never heard him, and am looking to his coming with
expectation."</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>A young woman who is working out a Homestead and Timber Claim in
Nebraska, and has been for several years supplied with much reading
matter by Miss Ellis, which she has circulated so zealously as to have
become one of the "branch missions," writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"When I was about seventeen years old I joined the Baptist Church
in Newport, Ky. (where at the time I was residing, and teaching in
the public school in that city); and I was sincere in what I did,
only I had so many doubts about many things that they taught, and
hesitated from the beginning of the revival until the close before
I could decide. Then my decision was made on this, that there were
older persons belonging to the church that said they believed the
teachings and doctrine, and I thought when I grew older and had
more experience that I would understand, and I had a delicate fear
to converse with the older members about my doubts for fear of
their opinions of me; so I quietly stayed with them for a number of
years, when an old friend, a good woman, now gone from among us,
induced me to attend your church, Mr. Wendte then being the pastor.
The subject he was to speak about was 'the Christ we know.' I
remember my thoughts then were about these,&mdash;'Christ they know? I
don't believe they know any,' and thought I should like to hear
what he would say, any way. I well remember that sermon; not one
sentence he uttered jarred me in the least; and, strange to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> say,
they were my own thoughts on the subject; but I dared not, even if
I could, have expressed myself. I thought over that sermon the
whole week every spare moment I had, and even took some that did
not justly belong to me. I shall never forget that week. The next
Sunday his text was, 'the God we love.' For all I enjoyed the
previous sermon, I still thought, 'They love God? Impossible!' and
as my friends invited me to go over with them again, I accepted the
invitation. I never had God represented to me before as now,&mdash;more
like a kind father than an austere judge; yes, kind, compassionate,
and loving us all alike, condemning only our evil actions. This
suited me exactly; so another week was spent in thought. I would
think, 'How can I conscientiously be a Baptist and believe this
way?' Yet how I disliked leaving the church where many things were
endeared to me. It seemed as if I was in a sea of trouble and
doubt, not knowing whether to go on or halt and turn back. The next
Sunday the subject was, 'the Bible we revere.' I was more than
anxious to hear this one, for it seemed to me that on this I would
have to decide. I went, and decided. I broke off gradually from my
old associations, and attended the services in the Unitarian church
from that time until I came West. I never joined the church, but it
suited my views best of all churches, and to-day I cannot go in any
of the Orthodox churches and feel at home. Now as regards this
mission work that you wish me to engage in, I could devote half an
hour each day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> and am willing to do all I can for the advancement
of the cause. My health became very poor, and I went West thinking
it would be beneficial. I must say I succeeded, for I am not
compelled to stay now for my health, but business keeps me here....
My homestead is three miles from the town, and I go out quite often
and stay over Sunday. My house is a very small dug-out. I raised
about ten bushels of potatoes, some beans, and a few squashes; have
done work I never thought of doing,&mdash;that is, planting vegetables,
made my own bedstead, put a floor in the house, and lined it with
sacking. Some of my lady friends assisted me when they came to see
me, and gave me ideas about my new kind of work. Now last, but not
least, in regard to Miss Ellis. I wrote to her directly after
coming West, and told her I felt isolated from church attendance,
but was pleased to find so many people with whom I could converse
on Liberal thought. Since that time she had kindly furnished me
with reading matter which I have again sent on its errand of peace
and joy. I looked over a bundle of letters and can only find this
postal card from her.... This card I send you is one she sent me in
reference to Mr. Copeland. I wrote her for his address, which she
gave me, and I requested him to come to our town and speak to the
people here. He kindly consented to come, and spoke on 'Into the
Light.' The majority of the people that heard him were well
pleased, and he promised me that whenever he passed our town on his
way to or from Denver he would stop over and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> speak. Would like to
have the card returned, as I want it for a remembrance."</p></blockquote>

<p>In her first letter written after Miss Ellis's death she said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Imagine how I felt when I came to your letter, and read the sad
news of Miss Ellis's death. I feared the worst when I did not hear
from her, for a friend had written me of her decline; but Miss
Ellis herself never referred to her illness but once to me. She
certainly must have been a patient and uncomplaining invalid, and
I, with many others no doubt, feel as if I had lost a dear friend,
and would be pleased to receive one of the memorials as a
keepsake.... I can assure you that I do all I can towards building
up a religion that all could conscientiously embrace. ... All the
reading matter sent to me I distribute to the best of my ability,
and hope that as it goes on its mission good seed will be sown.
There are numbers of Liberal people here who do not belong to any
church; and then I find a number of Liberals belonging to Orthodox
churches. I will subscribe for Mr. Savage's sermons, for I like his
sermons best of all."</p></blockquote>

<p>Miss Ellis numbered several physicians among her correspondents. One
living in Alabama writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Your Conference speaks truly when it says, 'Many of Miss Ellis's
correspondents had come to regard her as a dear friend, though
never having seen her face.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> I feel that I too may have the
privilege and the honor of being enrolled among the number of her
unseen friends. I hope some of the good seed she sowed has fallen
in good ground, even at this distance from the kind hand that
scattered them, and that their fruit may not</p>

<p>I am a regular subscriber to the 'Christian Register' and the
'Unitarian,' all through the influence of Miss Ellis."</p></blockquote>

<p>A man on a remote plantation in Georgia, who has been most zealous in
spreading the new light around him, writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Please accept thanks for papers and memorial of Miss Sallie Ellis.
She has been a good and a kind friend to me, has supplied me for
over two years with the best of literature, something new, so
different from what we are used to, something that lifts me above
myself and gives me new views of heaven and immortality, makes me a
better man to wife, family, neighbors, stock, and fills my heart
with that new love, the divine brotherhood of all mankind. I deeply
lament her loss. I do wish she could have lived a little while
longer, for my sake. I do feel so thankful for the papers, and
Channing, from Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, God bless her!... Any books or papers
sent me will be used to the good of the community. The Post Office
Mission is doing a good work."</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>A young German in Tennessee to whom she sent much reading matter wrote
her:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I am a German by birth, and received my education at German
universities. I devoted many years to the study of the chief
philosophical systems, and had in consequence of the results
derived from the latter for a long time little or no connection
with any church whatever. But during the last four or five years I
became more and more convinced that no school of thought possesses
so glorious a light as is emanating from the life and lessons of
Jesus Christ. So when I became acquainted with Channing's Works,
seeing that it is possible to reconcile with every scientific
discovery and with every logical conclusion all that is special in
Christianity, I knew I had found what I want and wherein to rest.
From my own standpoint, and remembering the religious
indifferentism which is now general in my native country and in
France, I regard Unitarianism as the principle which is to save the
Christian Church from ruin, and which will be an indestructible
bulwark against Nihilism and materialism. I still believe there is
a great future before the Unitarian Church."</p></blockquote>

<p>From a lady in Alabama to Miss Ellis:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;For such you have been to me, and it is to you I am
indebted for the papers, tracts, and sermons that I have received
and enjoyed so much. I have derived genuine comfort from them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> and
sincerely thank you for thinking of one so unhappy and so tossed
about for a haven of rest. Truly yours is a heavenly mission,
answering the needs of many like myself afflicted beyond human aid.
The sermons of James Freeman Clarke are peculiarly comforting; and
indeed I have read all you sent me with the deepest interest and
benefit. How I wish I might in some way recompense your Society as
it deserves! And you individually have my deepest gratitude, which
is so little for such thoughtfulness as yours.</p></blockquote>

<p>A second letter says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Your papers, sermons, etc., are regularly received, and I wish I
could make you understand the great comfort they are to me,
particularly the sermons. Anything pertaining to the future life
holds me spell-bound till the last word is read. The Unitarian
ideas and beliefs, so far as I know, find echo in my heart; and I
always feel comforted and soothed, as it were, with all I have read
and understood. I attend the Presbyterian Church here, because I
think it is better to attend some church regularly; and I am very
fond of this minister socially. There has been for ten days or more
an evangelist holding a union meeting in our church, and a night or
two ago I went to hear him. The only feeling excited in my heart
was one of pity that all persons could not be taught the love of
God instead of being frightened into a nervous fear. I assure you,
I feel it a privilege to correspond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> with you, and find myself
wishing in my heart that you knew me thoroughly, what I have been,
and what I am by nature, education, and social standing. I feel
that we women of the South are to be seen at home and known to be
understood by our Northern sisters."</p></blockquote>

<p>The following are some of Miss Ellis's letters to a radical of the
radicals, an old gentleman in Boston, one of Theodore Parker's old
congregation, who sent much literature out under her direction, and
contributed Theodore Parker's "Prayers," and his new volume of sermons,
to her loan library.</p>

<blockquote><p class="right"><span class="smcap">July 2, 1883.</span></p>

<p>Your letter was received on Thursday, and, contrary to your
expectation, was read with a great deal of interest, for I always
admire to have every one speak with perfect freedom, and I am very
glad you wrote as you did, and feel honored by having so old a man
for a correspondent.... You and I won't quarrel on the Bible
question. Rather think I should come up to your expectations on
<i>that</i> point.... I do not consider Mr. C&mdash;&mdash; or Mr. S&mdash;&mdash; authority
any more than I consider the Bible so; I read for myself and settle
the question as best I can. Am I not right? I have not read Colenso
on the Pentateuch, nor Davidson's "Introduction to the New
Testament," but <i>have</i> read "Canon of the Bible," Knappert's
"Religion of Israel," Stanley's "Eastern Church," Higginson's
"Spirit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> the Bible," Dr. Noyes's Translation of Prophets,
Psalms, Job, and Canticles, and lastly, "Bible for Learners." I
merely mention these to let you see I have been a student of the
Bible. Will also add Alger's "Future Life," J. F. Clarke's "Ten
Great Religions" and "Thomas Didymus," Savage's "Talks about
Jesus," and his sermons this winter on the Bible.... I think of
heaven and hell as you do; but having always been fed on Unitarian
teachings, am not so "bitter" in my feelings as those who have had
the "Assembly's Shorter Catechism" to overcome. In short, if people
only <i>live</i> truly from day to day, I will excuse their view of the
Bible, and of God, and Christ, as long as they do not wish me to
think the same as they do, for I decidedly think they are wrong....
I shall be very much pleased to have a copy of Theodore Parker's
"Prayers," and shall gladly accept a copy for my circulating
library; for, but with the exception of a few donations, the books
loaned have been those I put in it.</p></blockquote>

<p>After receiving the book, she wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"First, I must tell you how much I am enjoying Theodore Parker's
'Prayers.' They are suitable in most instances to the present day,
and for all ages and times, and one rises from reading them with
kindlier, broader thoughts, and renewed in strength. Am very glad
to have the book. Shall endeavor to sell copies of it this
winter.... I cannot <i>exactly</i> agree with all you said in your
letter, for I think it is not necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> yet to give up all
theology, though it should not be the main thing in religion. The
chief thing is to <i>do</i> right, and people arrive at that by
different methods. They will inquire and discuss theology, and
therefore it is necessary as yet that ministers should preach it,
and I do not believe that Orthodox ministers have arrived at Mr.
Savage's or Mr. Chadwick's views exactly, or they would come out
and say so. As for myself, I still enjoy the Communion service,
partaking of the bread and wine, and cannot agree to casting aside
Jesus as a helper to a better life, though I neither worship him
nor think that he redeems us in any other way than as by following
his example we become one with him and God. He 'died for us' in no
other sense than as a soldier dies for his country. Then let
theology continue, for the world is fast becoming better and better
in spite of it, and the time <i>may</i> come when we shall need it no
longer. We are gradually coming to the point. I do not regret the
time 'lost' I have spent on theology, for it has fitted me for just
the work I am engaged in, and many are the questions I am called
upon to answer, either by letter or printed matter; therefore I am
glad to know where to send perplexed minds. As a friend wrote me
from the South, 'Your papers are a great help to me. You are doing
more good than the women did in the days of our Saviour. They
clothed the body and you are feeding the souls.' Both acts are
needed, but in different directions, and some people can better do
the one, and others the other. I am cut off from active benevolence
from want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> of health for it, and am glad to know there are souls
needing nourishment. Do you not take this view too?"</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p class="right"><span class="smcap">December 20, 1883.</span></p>

<p>Your kind letter awaited my return from the city last evening, when
I returned at ten. It grieved me to think that possibly I had
wounded your feelings, for your "heresies" have not been "too
tough" for me, as you fear. One's religious belief never troubles
me as long as they do not force me into the same belief. Should be
sorry if I had not "charity" enough to see the good in one, and not
look at the outside merely. Your last letter reached me September
28, and I replied by postal October 19, as there did not appear to
be anything especial to require a letter; and as my eyes were
troubling me much at the time, I was compelled to desist from all
but necessary letters. Am still as much interested in the good
cause as ever, and we still have new applications constantly. We
are gaining ground in the South. One gentleman in Alabama is much
interested in Unitarianism, and wrote, asking me for Mr. Savage's
address, whereupon he wrote to Mr. Savage himself, who is sending
him "Unity Pulpit" present series. I am subscriber to it myself,
and never can keep a sermon. I subscribed for the benefit of
others. In Independence, Ky., a gentleman lately wrote, asking for
Unitarian papers, etc. He is highly satisfied. Has been groping in
the dark a long time, and wrote me, "When I read the pamphlet,
'What Do Unitarians Believe?' by C. W. Wendte, I shouted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> 'Eureka!'
Like it so well that I shall not part with it." So it goes on all
the time. Some one finds just what they have been in search of for
some time.</p></blockquote>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<blockquote><p class="right"><span class="smcap">February 19, 1885.</span></p>

<p>Am much obliged to you for sending matter to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;. He is
extremely radical, a farmer, with a large family to educate, and
cannot get such religious matter as he needs. You might, if you
choose, send the Chadwick sermons to him too, or, if you prefer
they should go elsewhere, address them to me, and I will send them
where they are needed.</p></blockquote>

<p>Her last postal card to this correspondent, dated about a month before
her death, says:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Thanks for the six 'Unity Pulpits' received. I have been too busy
to reply before, and my health still feeble, though not confined to
the house or bed at all. I'm not one of that kind until necessary."</p></blockquote>

<p>Since her death, the farmer referred to above has written:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I want to pay my humble tribute to the departed Miss Ellis. I
never met her; but she was my friend, because she was the friend to
all struggling humanity. She sent me sermons, etc., but above all,
<i>kind words</i>. I had pictured her in my mind as a strong, robust
person, and hoped at some future time to meet her. I now fear that
I may have wounded her refined soul by some things I wrote to her.
I am somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> 'agnostic;' but I love to think of heaven if such as
Miss Ellis preside there and give tone to the surroundings."</p></blockquote>

<p>The old gentleman in Boston wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"With this please receive eight letters and seventeen full postals
from our dear departed friend, Miss Sarah Ellis, of your city,
whose face I never saw, but whose correspondence was to me a great
pleasure. Her personal friendship must have been a real blessing to
you and her immediate friends. She was able to be a very active
worker for the cause which lay so near her heart, and was at the
same time so perfectly willing to let others believe what they can.
I will send all I have of hers and let you select what you desire.
There is not even a postal card among them on which there is not
some small or large trace of her noble, generous, kindly nature."</p></blockquote>

<p>A young man in Ohio, writing Miss Ellis about some revival scenes in his
town, makes this comment, which is good and true enough to settle the
"leaven" idea once for all.</p>

<blockquote><p>"If you had seen all this as I have, you would hardly think it time
for a civilized organization like the Unitarians to cease fighting
the great evil and wait for the leaven to work.</p>

<p>"<i>The Unitarians are themselves a portion of the leaven, and unless
they work there is so much of the leaven idle.</i>"</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>A Christian minister with whom Miss Ellis has corresponded two years or
more, and who expects to enter Harvard Divinity School, in sending her
letters writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"... I send such as I can get at, preferring to let you make any
suitable selections or extracts they may offer. I shall be pleased
to have them returned, as you mention, when you have used them. I
may add that my correspondence with Miss Ellis on all matters
connected with religion, Unitarianism, etc., was in all respects
most pleasant, satisfactory, and profitable to me. The careful
skill with which she divined the exact want of a correspondent and
sent the appropriate word by tract or letter to supply it, bespoke
a wisdom and experience deeper than casual letters may reveal. And
continued correspondence served thus to inspire a greater esteem
and confidence in the judgment expressed."</p></blockquote>

<p>The following extracts are from her letters to this minister:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="right"><span class="smcap">November 12, 1883.</span></p>

<p>Your letter was received a week since, and read with interest. What
you said of our teachings, of course, was light and just. We do not
expect ministers of other denominations to accept our views
altogether, for if so they would <i>be</i> Unitarians. Your view
concerning studying the Bible agrees with mine. Still, it is well
to know the latest view of the Bible, although we cannot accept the
teaching at first. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> time the way is made clear to us. Have
mailed to you to-day two more good tracts and our church programme
for this year. After Wednesday will mail to you "Positive Aspects
of Religion," by English leaders. We will agree to let you have any
book at just what it costs us, you paying postage on it....
Theodore Parker's "Discourses Pertaining to Religion" is a good
book for you to read,&mdash;usual price, $1.00. But first, "Orthodoxy;
Its Truths and Errors," J. F. Clarke; and a new book just out,
"Orthodoxy and Heresy." ... "Bible for Learners" is by three German
divines, translated by an Englishman, and gives the latest German
views concerning the Bible.</p></blockquote>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<blockquote><p class="right"><span class="smcap">December 23, 1883.</span></p>

<p>... At the time your letter reached me we were holding our annual
fair, and since then I have been much occupied with preparing for
Christmas. To-day am home-bound by the snow,&mdash;it being knee-deep
between our front door and the gate, and as I have to walk half a
mile to take the street cars to the city, and as it is raining on
top of the deep snow, concluded it was really too bad for me to
venture. Have read myself out, and being very much occupied during
the week, will take advantage of the holy-day to speak on a holy
topic. You suggested that we send "papers representing Unitarian
ideas rather than tracts;" but papers do not contain our doctrines
so explicitly. Since your last letter, have mailed to you two
tracts on "Inspiration" and "Incarnation" which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> I thought well
answered the thoughts expressed in your letter.</p>

<p>You will see from them that Unitarians are little troubled about
Inspiration and the Divinity, or the Deity of Christ as we prefer
to state it. We do believe in his divinity, for we hold that all
men are divine, while we deny his being Deity. We lay greater
stress on the divinity of human nature, and therefore we do not
feel that Jesus is degraded by calling him man, for we exalt man.
If we considered man totally depraved, then to call Jesus a mere
man might seem to lower him; but when we think of the possibilities
of man, and that he has it within himself to reach up to the
highest manhood, and to become in a measure a saviour of the world,
then to compare him with Jesus&mdash;the most glorious of men&mdash;is not
lessening the divinity of the Christ, it seems to me. Or, if we
held Jesus to be God, a being different from man, and so far
superior to us that we never could attain to his goodness, then we
never could compare the two. Jesus is an example to us because we
also are divine as he is; for he prays "that they all may be one,
as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in
us." If man had not been of the same nature as himself, would he
have thus spoken? I advise you to send to the Western Unitarian
Sunday School Society for Rev. William C. Gannett's Sunday School
Lesson, "The Christmas Poem and the Christmas Fact," if you wish to
understand how Unitarians of the present day understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> Christ.
Though you may not accept, you will have our idea of the birth
legends in our Gospels.</p></blockquote>

<p>My reply to your letter, by postal, was written before talking with
&mdash;&mdash;. She tells me that Harvard will be decidedly the better place
if not too expensive. Meadville has the advantage in that
respect,&mdash;less expensive; but being near Boston, Cambridge offers
better opportunities for students to engage in work by which they
can support themselves in the mean time. A correspondent of ours
went to Harvard a year ago last September. Had a scholarship
promised him. He found a set of books to keep, and studied.... I
tell you of this case, as it may help you in your decision.
Meadville is very thorough, but think the younger men all give
preference to Harvard; I presume as much as anything on account of
the opportunities which being near Boston affords them. I have
written to Professor C. C. Everett of Harvard to please send you a
catalogue and answer your inquiries. We shall be very glad if our
little Cincinnati branch of the Women's Auxiliary Conference is the
means of securing them another Divinity student. With many good
wishes of the season from the Women's Auxiliary Conference,</p>

<p>Have been obliged to change my residence, and, temporarily, am with
another brother. Just came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> here to-day, and, not having my things
about me, have not your last letter to refer to, but having
received a letter from our Harvard Divinity Student this past week,
wish to tell you what he says of his surroundings, and his
impression of Professor Everett. He writes as follows: "I enjoy the
work of the Divinity School more than I had ever hoped. We have a
noble corps of professors eminently fitted for their special
departments, and personally most eminent examples of Nature's
noblemen. In the light of what I am now learning, I consider my
former ignorance phenomenal. Thanks to Professor Everett, my faith
in God is clearer and stronger than ever before. He has enabled me
to reduce my chaotic philosophy to something of a system, and has
helped to furnish a steadfast basis for faith. His lectures are
simply invaluable. To my mind he is not only the greatest man in
the Divinity School, but the greatest man in Harvard University;
and not only the profoundest thinker in the Unitarian Church in our
country, but the profoundest thinker to be found in any American
church." ... I feel that this will be of interest to you, who are
contemplating going to the Divinity School. There is another thing
I wish to speak of; that is, we have quite a valuable book, "The
Origin of the Doctrine of the Trinity," by Hugh H. Stannus, of
England, showing how much greater cause there is for believing in
the Unity of God than in the Trinity. You can have the book any
time you wish, though I have just mailed it to a lady in this
State. By the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> way, the daughter of James F. Clarke, with others,
has planned a course of "Unitarian Studies at Home." The first
year's course includes: 1. "The Unitarian Doctrine of Prayer," by
J. F. Clarke; 2. "The Origin of the Doctrine of the Trinity," by

"Register," January 8, I read with much interest. We have such an
interesting young convert, a Methodist, in Canada. His intention is
to study for the Unitarian ministry, we having brought him out into
the light. I thought with how much interest he would read that
sermon of Mr. Wendte's.</p></blockquote>

<p>A gentleman in Mississippi, superintendent of schools in his county,
writes of Miss Ellis as</p>

<blockquote><p>"... One whose memorial I read with a saddened heart. A single
request to her consequent upon an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> advertisement which I saw in a
paper commenced a correspondence which continued uninterruptedly
till the time of her death. Though just from the side of a dear
sister whom she had left destined to a glorious immortality, she
found time to write to us a letter of condolence on the great loss
that we had sustained in the death of our son,&mdash;a young man just of
age,&mdash;in which she blended submission to Him 'who doeth all things
right,' with such words of comfort as could emanate only from a
good, earnest, self-sacrificing instrument of our Heavenly Father.
Than in her life of trials and troubles there has never been a
greater instance of the victory of mind over matter. I am afraid
that I do little good with the sermons, etc., among the people
here, who, although they use the beautiful hymn, 'Nearer, my God,
to Thee,' at their funerals, still look upon Unitarians as cultured
heathens."</p></blockquote>

<p>A lady in Ohio, who became a regular correspondent and bought many
books, wrote Miss Ellis:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The lectures and papers you have sent have been, and are, the
source of much pleasure to me; and I have given them to some of my
friends, who also seemed pleased with them. I had thought for a
long time that the Unitarian faith would be my idea of true
religion, and now I feel <i>sure</i> of it. I knew nothing about its
creed, or whether it had one, but had had a desire for several
years to know something of it. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> my friends and acquaintances
were as ignorant as myself, and the most definite idea I had been
able to gain concerning it was through James Freeman Clarke's
'Self-Culture.' When I found your little notice in the newspaper,
it was just what I most desired. I have always wished to be
religious; but there are things in the Bible which my reason
repels, and the Orthodox way of teaching them became at last so
abhorrent to me that at one time I just gave it all up and ceased
to try to believe any of it; though I am sure I always felt the
beauty of Christianity as taught by Christ, and would be glad now
to be a Christian, if not compelled to believe him the miraculous
Son of God.... We like the 'Register' better and better all the
time, and I have no doubt shall subscribe for it regularly. I
consider it exceedingly high-toned as a moral and religious
teacher, and also in a literary point of view. The sermons and
lectures supply for us a long-felt need. I intend sending a list of
names of friends and acquaintances to the publishers soon. My
sister-in-law has become a convert to the Unitarian faith through
the medium of the 'Register' and the tracts you have sent me from
time to time. She is quite an enthusiast, and feels that
Unitarianism is a great boon and comfort to her now in the midst of
her troubles. [The sister had recently lost her husband.] She, like
myself, could not conscientiously subscribe to the old Orthodox
creeds and requirements, and so remained outside the Church; but
now she feels that she may be a Christian without stultifying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> her
sense of reason. When she returns home, she expects to subscribe
for the 'Register.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>After Miss Ellis's death she wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I received the memorial of Miss Ellis. I thank you sincerely for
sending it. It is very touching and beautiful, and delineates just
such a character as I conceived hers to be. I had received the sad
intelligence of her death through the 'Christian Register' before
the memorial reached me, and it was like the shock of learning of
the death of a personal friend. I have great reason to be grateful
to her and to cherish her memory; for through her I have been led
to embrace and to love the broad and charitable Unitarian belief.
My reason had struggled for years against the great&mdash;to
me&mdash;stumbling-blocks of Orthodoxy, and had finally abandoned the
conflict and settled down into a kind of unthinking unbelief,
feeling that it was no use to try to subscribe to any Orthodox
creed, and not knowing where to look for any more hopeful, helpful,
or reasonable spiritual aid. About four years ago, I think it was,
I saw the notice in the paper which is referred to in the memorial,
and Then ensued a very pleasant correspondence ... wrote Miss Ellis
asking for Unitarian papers, etc. much like that with a dear
familiar friend, and she grew to be like one to me, or rather was
that almost from the first. She put so much of her real self into
her letters that they were like a living presence. So full she was
of true Christian love and feeling, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> ever ready to forget her
own sorrows and sufferings in her sympathy with the sorrows of
others, that thus unconsciously truth and love and
self-forgetfulness were stamped upon every line that came from her
mind and hand. Truly she was 'A Little Pilgrim,' bearing good
tidings to the fainting and weary, and lifting them up with her own
heavenly strength. Sacred be her memory! Through her I became a
subscriber to the 'Christian Register,' which is to me a standard
of excellence in a religious, moral, and intellectual point of
view. I do not want to be sectarian, as that is not my ideal of a
good Unitarian,&mdash;I mean in an 'offensive' light; but it really
seems to me that even Unitarian wit and fun have a refinement and
exquisite touch of humor which cannot be equalled among Orthodox
publications. The 'Register,' however, is the only Unitarian paper
that I am well acquainted with. A widowed sister-in-law who is with
me also became a Unitarian through Miss Ellis. She is a subscriber
to 'The Unitarian.' We also have Channing's Works and the 'Oriental
Christ,' which I bought through Miss Ellis, and some of Freeman
Clarke's books; so that we have the companionship of much of the
best Unitarian thought, although we are denied the privilege of a
personal ministry."</p></blockquote>

<p>From Springfield, Ohio:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I have been greatly benefited by the papers, sermons, etc., you
have so kindly sent me. Hope to have them continued. Will try to
have some Unitarian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> volumes put in our public library. After
reading the papers I loan them out to others. Some sermons thus
pass into six or eight homes. They set people to thinking. I thank
you, and your good Society, for the broad Christian education you
are giving me. Will do all I can as your missionary here."</p></blockquote>

<p>Rev. Samuel May, Leicester, Mass., having offered to send his "Register"
to some one, Miss Ellis arranged that it should go to the writer of the
above, who acknowledged it as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Your postal received. I am very grateful for this kindness, and,
as I read the 'Register' this morning, I resolved to use it for
others also.... Can't your Association give the ball a push at this
place?"</p></blockquote>

<p>The following extract is from the first letter of a new correspondent,
dated Dec. 8, 1885. To him was begun the last postal card, which she was
unable to finish. She was so eager about it, dictating faster than one
could write. "Tell him I think he will like us when he knows us better,"
she said.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Your postal came all right, also copies of several tracts, and
specimens of 'Register' and 'Unity.' They are mainly in lines of
thought which I have been working on for some years. I am at one
with the authors in main points, but not prepared to accept all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> of
the so-called advanced or radical expressions. My own experience,
observation, and reflection seem to show that they have swung too
far from Orthodoxy, and the truth lies between; but I am not fit to
decide yet. From the pamphlet of selections of Channing's writings,
with which I am particularly pleased, I have derived some ideas
which inspire me for a greater activity, and I hope a more
effective activity, in my work of teaching.... I have a friend who
also feels dissatisfied with current Orthodoxy. If you see fit, I
wish you to send him some of those tracts. I wish to use my copies
here, or I would send them."</p></blockquote>

<p>The estimation in which Miss Ellis was held by some of her
fellow-workers appears in the following extracts from letters and
papers.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of a letter, a part of which is given elsewhere, Rev.
A. A. Livermore, President of Meadville Theological School, says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"But though disinterested and devoted to family interests and
helpful to the growing households of her brothers and sisters, the
crowning interest that came to absorb and inspire her advanced
Christian life was the propagation of her own Unitarian faith,
early learned, later disciplined, and mellowed and sanctified by
trial and years. What had been a stay and staff to her own mind and
heart she was anxious to communicate to others. Hence she sought
the instrumentalities of the pen and press, and the Post Office
Mission sprang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> into being,&mdash;the invention of a Christian woman's
heart, bent on doing good spiritually. The zeal, fidelity,
sympathy, and adaptation with which she developed and pursued this
work have been told elsewhere. It is another lesson to teach us
that ever new means will arise, as time and opportunity serve, for
the faithful in heart and life to hasten the coming of the Master's
kingdom of righteousness and love. Miss Ellis infused a sweetness
and sympathy all her own into her mission. To her it was no task,
but a delight, as her letters show,&mdash;her meat and drink to help
struggling souls to light and Christian faith. Peace to her
beautiful and saintly memory!"</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p class="center">(From Rev. S. J. Barrows, editor "Christian Register.")</p>

<p class="center">A CANDLE OF THE LORD.</p>

<p>It was a feeble socket that held it. It was a constant surprise
that so small a candle could give forth so much light. But its
special mission was not so much to illumine the world with its own
light as it was to ignite other minds and hearts from its own
flame. "Behold how much wood is kindled by how small a fire!" says
the apostle. Nothing is small, it has been said, which is great in
its consequences. It does not need a stroke of lightning from
heaven to raze Chicago to the ground: a little lamp-flame near a
pile of hay is sufficient. We forget sometimes the power of a
single humble life to extend and duplicate its influence. We have
never learned yet how far the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> candle can throw its beams,
when its waves of light and heat come in contact with minds and
hearts that are prepared for the illumination it may give. The wire
and the battery have not entirely superseded the torch-bearer. The
lamps in the house may have been filled, the gas may be ready to
turn on; what is needed is for some one to go about with match or
torch or candle, and tip the burner with its flame.</p>

<p>So, as we have said, it was the mission of this candle of the Lord
to ignite other minds and hearts. She had discovered that the vast
system of intercommunication established by the post-office might
be used for moral as well as for commercial means. In connection
with a faithful co-worker, she devoted herself to the dissemination
of kindling literature. Set like a luminous panel amid a great wall
of advertisements was a brief notice, in some of the large Western
dailies, that those who wished Liberal religious literature might
have it for the asking, and by sending to the Cincinnati Post
Office Mission. In the columns of this paper, from time to time, we
have shown what a wide-spread influence these little notices had.
They opened avenues of communication to many hungry souls. The
confidence of many in doubt and perplexity was secured. The lady
who was called to this special work had a keen intuition as to what
was needed in each special case. It was not only that she sent the
right tracts and the right books, and thus set up guide-posts for
groping men and women; not less prized by many of her
correspondents was the simple, earnest faith and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> cordial sympathy
which she expressed in her own letters. Many are grateful to her
for pointing out the way and giving the right impulse at the right
time. Prevented by deafness from taking an active part in social
intercourse, she yet found an opportunity to unstop the deaf ears
of others and to open their blind eyes. In this Post Office Mission
work was a channel for her faithful and consecrated endeavors.</p>

<p>We cannot estimate the radiating influence of such a life. Its
quickening flame has gone from heart to heart, and it is destined
to go still further. Her devoted example has given an impulse to
many other women in the Unitarian body, who are sowing in the same
field the seed for an abundant harvest. It is now seen that this
diffusion of our literature is one of the mightiest means for
propagating our faith. If such a devoted woman, working
independently, could accomplish so much, how much more might be
effected by thorough organizations and wide co-operation for the
same purpose!</p>

<p>Her best monument will be the prosecution and extension of the work
to which she gave her life. It was but a pair of lines in the
"Deaths" of the last week's "Register" which told that the candle
had gone out, but its flame is still propagated in the lives it has
served to kindle. The great work of her life was done far beyond
the circle of her immediate influence; and there are many who have
never seen her in the flesh, who will still feel that the name of
Sarah Ellis represents an abiding spiritual reality.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">(From Rev. George A. Thayer in "Unity," Jan. 23, 1886.)</p>

<p class="center">SARAH ELLIS.</p>

<p>Sarah Ellis, the faithful organizer of the Cincinnati Post Office
Mission, and the pioneer in that admirable form of the ministry of
Unitarian doctrine through the writing of letters and the
circulation of religious literature, "went up higher" from her
sick-bed, on Sunday evening, December 27. There are many, East and
West, to whom her wise guidance in spiritual perplexities has been
as a strong hand lifting them from confusion and doubt concerning
all religion, into tranquil joy, who will read that she is dead,
with the shock which comes with an unforewarned calamity. For
almost up to her last hour she was carrying on her correspondence
with the wide circle of men and women to whom she periodically sent
glad tidings of a reasonable faith, and never giving intimation to
the most regular of these correspondents that she was any less
vigorous of health than usual. For many months her friends had seen
the end approaching, and very likely she herself had understood
that "the task was great, the day short, and it was not incumbent
upon her to complete the work." But her inexorable conscience,
blended with her delight in having found at last, within this
recent five years, a work needing to be done, and calling into use
her store of admirable wisdom for such business, kept her at her
duty until the body ceased to obey the will.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>Only the people who knew Miss Ellis well could understand her rare
fitness for her office, through long and ripe study of Unitarian
religious literature, and through her genius for apprehending at
once what special reading and counsel her various applicants for
light upon their darkened ways of the spirit needed to
receive,&mdash;only those to whom she spoke the word in season, or those
nearer home to whom she was a quiet exemplar in holy things, can
appreciate the quality of virtue enclosed in that fragile and
infirm body, which shines on earth only "in minds made better by
its presence," but shines with renewed honor elsewhere in the house
of many mansions.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It was not my good fortune to know Miss Ellis personally, but her
works have praised her East as well as West. Her death is a great
calamity to the cause, as well as a great sorrow to her friends;
but she has put life and power into a good instrument of influence,
and it will live.</p>

a comfort to think that all suffering and weakness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> are over for
her; and so we can but rejoice that she has entered upon the
blessed life, although the feeling of loss must be very great. I
have thought often of Mr. Beach's sudden death last summer, during
the last few weeks, and I was glad to tell our friends, at the
meeting the other day, of Miss Ellis's tender, helping sympathy for
his mother and sisters at that time. I think one can hardly help
feeling that perhaps Miss Ellis and the young friend whom she had
led to a bright and happy faith may already have met and rejoiced
together in the heavenly life. Much sympathy has been expressed
here for Miss Ellis's father. I hope that the thought of all that

such as she. Each time I saw her I was impressed more and more with
the strength of her character and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> clearness and directness of
her mind. Upon meeting a stranger of whom one has heard much there
is almost always a little period of bewilderment before the ideal
and real can be harmonized, even where there is not disappointment;
and at first I was at a loss how to reconcile the strong,
well-balanced mind, with its keen insight,&mdash;as revealed in her
letters,&mdash;with the delicate, dainty, sweet-looking little woman,
shut out from her kind to so great a degree by her affliction. Yet
when her tiny hand grasped mine so firmly at our first meeting,
there was that in the clasp that reconciled and united my ideal
with the actual; they were only two sides of the same nature. She
was so strong, too, in being so genuine and so full of faith. In
these halting, doubting times, a faith in the eternal verities so
strong and unwavering as hers is like a rock to many a tossed and
uncertain soul. Such people do not know their own power of helping.
I can never refrain from questioning <i>why</i> those who are so needed
in the world must be taken, when the useless and worthless are
left, unless it is that they go that they may leave the <i>spirit</i> of
their service to do a larger work as a heritage to all who will
accept it. Though dead, they speak with many tongues.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fayette Smith</span>, Director of Women's Conference:</p>

<p>At a recent meeting of the Portland branch of the Women's Auxiliary
Conference, an article in the "Christian Register," entitled "A
Candle of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> Lord," was read; and on motion of Mrs. Dr. J. T.
Gilman, the Secretary was requested to express to your Conference
the sympathy of our little band in the death of Miss Sarah Ellis.
While we cannot have the sense of personal loss that you feel in
the extinguishment of that light, we have the highest admiration
for the work she accomplished under such limitations, and trust
that her example will be an incentive to every Unitarian woman to
do something to continue it, till the flame she kindled may become
a glorious light, glowing in every hamlet of our common country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Smith</span>,&mdash;As I have had the pleasure of a little
correspondence with dear Miss Ellis, our Society have asked me to
express to you our deep sympathy in your loss. She must have been a
remarkable woman to have accomplished so much when so feeble. Her
warm heart spoke plainly in her letters, and we shall regret more
and more, as time passes, that we shall receive them no more. Let
us believe that her freed spirit is not far off, but is still
interested, and far more able to help in the work she loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> so
well. Her sphere is only larger. Our branch of the Woman's
Auxiliary Conference resolved to incorporate in its minutes a
resolution of regret at her death, and sympathy with you, and to
preserve the "In Memoriam" you so kindly sent, among its papers.
Please accept our warmest sympathy and expression of interest.</p>

<p class="right">Yours sincerely, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Frances J. Myers.</span><br />
<i>For the Syracuse Branch of the Women's Auxiliary Conference.</i></p></blockquote>


<p>The Post Office Mission Committee at Davenport, Iowa, at their meeting
Feb. 10, also took formal action upon the death of Miss Ellis, and sent
expressions of "heartfelt regrets and sympathy" to the Cincinnati
Society.</p>

<blockquote><p class="right"><span class="smcap">Chicago</span>, March 29, 1886.</p>

<p>A part of Thursday afternoon, May 13, will be given to the Women's
Conference, and occupied with election of officers and report of
Post Office Mission work. It seems very appropriate that something
should be said at that time in memory of Miss Ellis; and Miss Le
Baron and I request that you prepare the paper or remarks and
present them.... We leave the form of the memorial entirely to your
judgment.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. E. A. West</span>,<br />
<i>Pres. Western Women's Unitarian Conf., Chicago, Ill.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In accordance with this request, Mrs. George Thornton, of
Cincinnati, read the following memorial before the Western Women's
Unitarian Conference, May 13, 1886:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Such an occasion as this, full of words of good counsel and
cheer,&mdash;a reunion of the little band of women workers in the cause
of Liberal Christianity,&mdash;will be incomplete if we do not mention
one name, held in loving remembrance in the hearts of many here
present, and of a still greater number scattered far and wide,
whose lives have been touched to higher issues by the active
ministrations of our beloved co-worker, Miss Sallie Ellis, who has
laid down her work on earth and passed on to the great Hereafter.</p>

<p>When we recall the fragile form, so full of the Spirit's life,
which, rising above the many disabilities of physical suffering,
accomplished so much in the brief years allotted her, we take
courage, and thank God that we have had such spirits with us.
Nothing doubting that their work continues here and elsewhere,
though we know neither the manner nor conditions of its progress.</p>

<p>We who are cheered in moments of sorrow by the great faith that the
future of those who have passed behind "the veil which hath no
outward swing" will be but a continuance of the <i>best</i>, under
nobler conditions, rejoice, even in the midst of personal
bereavement, that Miss Ellis has entered into that rest, so nobly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
won by her patient endurance of the heavy burdens laid upon
her,&mdash;burdens which yet never seemed to close her sympathy for
others, but only served to quicken her eagerness to work for the
extension of that vital faith she found so satisfying.</p>

<p>It is to her warm heart, and earnest desire to help others in the
midst of spiritual difficulties, that we owe the unique but most
efficacious method of reaching such through the medium of postal
communication.</p>

<p>Scientists tell us that each wavelet of sound, produced by the
tiniest cause, goes on in ever-widening circles of ether, to the
uttermost limits of creation. Had we but senses acute enough to
receive the sensation, how full of pulsing sound would all Nature
become! It seems to me that this keener sense, enabling her to
catch the questionings of troubled souls, became one of the great
compensations of Miss Ellis's later years. As the outer organs of
hearing became dulled to what was passing around her, the inner or
spiritual became more observant; and as we listened to the
correspondence which came to her from North and South, East and
West, from the home and the camp, from the teacher and the taught,
we seemed to stand in some great whispering-gallery, echoing with
the sighs and anxious inquiries of seekers after truth who sought
aid in solving the great problems of the soul's life. As from time
to time came back acknowledgments of gratitude for aid rendered,
either by her sympathizing letters or the Liberal literature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> which
she widely disseminated, we realized what a great lever had been
applied in this simple way to the spiritual needs of many.</p>

<p>It is in this phase of Miss Ellis's work that she has become better
known to the members of the Women's Auxiliary Conference; and it is
of this especially I have spoken to-day.</p>

<p>But the roots of this activity lie deeper, and this work was but
the fruitage of a life which drew its strength to suffer and
endure, as well as to labor and to wait, from those fountains of a
rational faith for whose extension we have met here this week.</p>

<p>To her it was the manna of life, and it was fitting that her last
years should have been spent in unselfish endeavor to extend its
influence.</p>

<p>Knowing how heartily she would have entered into the spirit of our
meetings during this Conference, we cannot leave unsaid the word of
tender remembrance which links her memory indissolubly with the
work of our Women's Auxiliary Conference. The little band who are
engaged in spreading the light of a higher faith, in lifting the
load of crude ideas in regard to our relations to God and humanity,
may surely feel that though our friend "has joined the choir
invisible," yet her work "lives on in lives made better by her
presence," still keeping alive the union with us who remain
behind,&mdash;a help and incentive to continued progress.</p>

<p>No better key-note of Miss Ellis's life can be given than in the
words of a poem copied by her into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> her diary, January, 1881. It
was taken from the "Woman's Journal," and was entitled:&mdash;</p>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
